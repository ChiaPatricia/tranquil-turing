## Purpose of the MITI

MITI is a behavioral coding system that assesses how well or how poorly a clinician is using motivational interviewing. It is intended to be used as a means of providing structured, formal feedback about ways to improve practice.

## COMPONENTS OF THE MITI

The MITI has two components: the global scores and the behavior counts.

A global score requires the coder to assign a single number from a five-point scale to characterize an entire interaction. These scores are meant to capture the rater's global impression or overall judgment about the dimension, sometimes called the 'gestalt'. Four global dimensions are rated: Cultivating Change Talk, Softening Sustain Talk, Partnership, and Empathy. This means that each MITI review will contain four global scores.

A behavior count requires the coder to tally instances of particular interviewer behaviors. These running tallies occur from the beginning of the segment being reviewed until the end. The coder is not required to judge the overall quality of the event, as with global scores, but simply to count each instance of the behavior.

## DESIGNATING A CHANGE GOAL

An important feature of the MITI involves focusing on a particular change goal and maintaining a specific direction about that change within the conversation. Change goals, sometimes called target behaviors, may be very specific and behavioral (e.g., reducing drinking, monitoring blood sugar, engaging in a treatment program). Coders must be told prior to coding what the designated change goal is for the interaction. This should be designated on the coding form by the coder, before coding begins. This will allow coders to judge more accurately whether the clinician is directing interventions toward the change goal and evoking content from the client about it.

## GLOBAL SCORES

Global scores are intended to capture the rater's overall impression of how well or poorly the clinician meets the description of the dimension being measured. Although this may be accomplished by simultaneously evaluating many small elements, the rater's all足-at足-once judgment is paramount. The global scores should reflect the holistic evaluation of the interviewer, which cannot necessarily be separated into individual elements.

Global scores are assigned on a five足-point Likert scale, with a minimum of '1' and a maximum of '5.' The coder assumes a default score of '3' and moves up or down as indicated. A '3' may also reflect mixed practice. A '5' is generally not given when there are prominent examples of poor practice in the segment.

## Gloal Score - Partnership

This scale is intended to measure the extent to which the clinician conveys an understanding that expertise and wisdom about change reside mostly within the client. Clinicians high on this scale behave as if the interview is occurring between two equal partners, both of whom have knowledge that might be useful in solving the change under consideration. Clinicians low on the scale assume the expert role for a majority of the interaction and have a high degree of influence in the nature of the interaction.

### Score of 1

1 - Clinician actively assumes the expert role for the majority of the interaction with the client. Collaboration or partnership is absent.

Examples:
- Explicitly takes the expert role by defining the problem, prescribing the goals, or laying out the plan of action
- Clinician actively forces a particular agenda for the majority of the interaction with the client
- Denies or minimizes client ideas
- Dominates conversation
- Argues when client offers alternative approach
- Often exhibits the righting reflex

### Score of 2

2 - Clinician superficially responds to opportunities to collaborate.

Examples:
- Clinician rarely surrenders the expert role
- Minimal or superficial querying of client input
- Often sacrifices opportunities for mutual problem solving in favor of supplying knowledge or expertise
- Minimal or superficial responses to client's potential agenda items, knowledge, idea, and/or concerns

### Score of 3

3 - Clinican incorporates client's contributions but does so in a lukewarm or erratic fashion.

Examples:
- May take advantage of opportunities to collaborate, but does not structure interaction to solicit this
- Misses some opportunities to collaborate when initiated by the client
- The righting reflex is largely absent
- Sacrifices some opportunities for mutual problem solving in favor of supplying knowledge or advice
- Seems to be in a stand-足off with the client; not wrestling and not dancing

### Score of 4

4 - Clinician fosters collaboration and power sharing so that client's contributions impact the session in ways that they otherwise would not.

Examples:
- Some structuring of the session to ensure client input
- Searches for agreement on problem definition, agenda setting, and goal setting
- Solicits client views in more than a perfunctory fashion
- Engages client in problem solving or brainstorming
- Does not attempt to educate or direct if client 'pushes back' with sustain talk
- Does not insist on resolution unless client is ready

### Score of 5

5 - Clinician actively fosters and encourages power sharing in the interaction in such a way that client's contributions substantially influence the nature of the session.

Examples:
- Genuinely negotiates the agenda and goals for the session
- Indicates curiosity about client ideas through querying and listening
- Facilitates client evaluation of options and planning
- Explicitly identifies client as the expert and decision maker
- Tempers advice giving and expertise depending on client input
- Clinician favors discussion of client's strengths and resources rather than probing for deficits

You are master therapist who is an expert in Motivational Interviewing. Using the reference above, wrapped in <reference> tags, provide a global score for Partnership based on the transcript wrapped in <transcript> tags. The transcript is provided in CSV format. The two important columns in each row are "P or C" and "Content of Utterance." The column "P or C" has a value of either "P" meaning "Provider" (the therapist) and C meaning "Client." The second column is the utterance made by the Provider or Client.
