## Purpose of the MITI

MITI is a behavioral coding system that assesses how well or how poorly a clinician is using motivational interviewing. It is intended to be used as a means of providing structured, formal feedback about ways to improve practice.

## COMPONENTS OF THE MITI

The MITI has two components: the global scores and the behavior counts.

A global score requires the coder to assign a single number from a five-­-point scale to characterize an entire interaction. These scores are meant to capture the rater's global impression or overall judgment about the dimension, sometimes called the 'gestalt'. Four global dimensions are rated: Cultivating Change Talk, Softening Sustain Talk, Partnership, and Empathy. This means that each MITI review will contain four global scores.

A behavior count requires the coder to tally instances of particular interviewer behaviors. These running tallies occur from the beginning of the segment being reviewed until the end. The coder is not required to judge the overall quality of the event, as with global scores, but simply to count each instance of the behavior.

## DESIGNATING A CHANGE GOAL

An important feature of the MITI involves focusing on a particular change goal and maintaining a specific direction about that change within the conversation. Change goals, sometimes called target behaviors, may be very specific and behavioral (e.g., reducing drinking, monitoring blood sugar, engaging in a treatment program). Coders must be told prior to coding what the designated change goal is for the interaction. This should be designated on the coding form by the coder, before coding begins. This will allow coders to judge more accurately whether the clinician is directing interventions toward the change goal and evoking content from the client about it.

## GLOBAL SCORES

Global scores are intended to capture the rater's overall impression of how well or poorly the clinician meets the description of the dimension being measured. Although this may be accomplished by simultaneously evaluating many small elements, the rater's all­-at­-once judgment is paramount. The global scores should reflect the holistic evaluation of the interviewer, which cannot necessarily be separated into individual elements.

Global scores are assigned on a five­-point Likert scale, with a minimum of '1' and a maximum of '5.' The coder assumes a default score of '3' and moves up or down as indicated. A '3' may also reflect mixed practice. A '5' is generally not given when there are prominent examples of poor practice in the segment.

## Gloal Score - Softening Sustain Talk

This scale is intended to measure the extent that the clinician avoids a focus on the reasons against changing or for maintaining the status quo. To achieve high scores, clinicians should avoid lingering in discussions concerning the difficulty or undesirability of change. Although therapists will sometimes choose to attend to sustain talk to build rapport, in general they should spend only as much time as needed to bring the discussion into more favorable territory for building motivation. High scores may also be achieved in the absence of sustain talk during a session, if the clinician does not engage in behaviors to evoke it. Low scores in Softening Sustain Talk are appropriate when clinicians focus considerable attention to the barriers of change, even when using MI-­‐consistent techniques (e.g., asking open questions, offers reflections, affirmations and other MI Adherent techniques) to evoke and reflect sustain talk throughout the session.

The scoring criteria for Softening Sustain Talk global score five-point scale are as follows:

### Score of 1

1 - Clinician consistently responds to the client’s language in a manner that facilitates the frequency or depth of arguments in favor of the status quo.

Examples:
- Explicitly asks for arguments against change, queries difficulties
- Actively seeks elaboration when sustain talk is offered through questions, reflections, or affirmations
- Preferential attention and reinforcement of sustain talk when it occurs alongside change talk
- Sustained curiosity and focus about reasons not change

### Score of 2

2 - Usually chooses to explore, focus on, or respond to client’s reasons to maintain the status quo.

Examples:
- Often deepens discussion of barriers or difficulties of change when client mentions them
- Asks about barriers to change on more than one occasion during the interview, even if the client does not bring up
- Often reflects benefits of the status quo

### Score of 3

3 - Clinican gives preference to the client's language in favor of the status quo, but may show some instances of shifting the focus away from sustain talk.

Examples:
- Some missed opportunities to shift focus away from sustain talk
- Attends to benefits of status quo even when client offers change talk

### Score of 4

4 - Clinician typically avoids an emphasis on client language favoring the status quo.

Examples:
- Does not explicitly ask for reasons not to change
- Minimal attention to sustain talk when it occurs
- Does not seek elaboration of sustain talk
- Lack of curiosity and focus on client's reasons to maintain the status quo
- Does not linger in discussions about barriers to change

### Score of 5

5 - Clinician shows a marked and consistent effort to decrease the depth, strength, or momentum of the client's language in favor of the status quo.

Examples:
- Uses structured therapeutic task(s) to shift the focus of sustain talk toward the target change goal
- May use double­-sided reflections (ending with a reflection of change talk) to move the conversation away from sustain talk
