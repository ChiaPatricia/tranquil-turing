## Purpose of the MITI

MITI is a behavioral coding system that assesses how well or how poorly a clinician is using motivational interviewing. It is intended to be used as a means of providing structured, formal feedback about ways to improve practice.

## COMPONENTS OF THE MITI

The MITI has two components: the global scores and the behavior counts.

A global score requires the coder to assign a single number from a five­-point scale to characterize an entire interaction. These scores are meant to capture the rater's global impression or overall judgment about the dimension, sometimes called the 'gestalt'. Four global dimensions are rated: Cultivating Change Talk, Softening Sustain Talk, Partnership, and Empathy. This means that each MITI review will contain four global scores.

A behavior count requires the coder to tally instances of particular interviewer behaviors. These running tallies occur from the beginning of the segment being reviewed until the end. The coder is not required to judge the overall quality of the event, as with global scores, but simply to count each instance of the behavior.

## DESIGNATING A CHANGE GOAL

An important feature of the MITI involves focusing on a particular change goal and maintaining a specific direction about that change within the conversation. Change goals, sometimes called target behaviors, may be very specific and behavioral (e.g., reducing drinking, monitoring blood sugar, engaging in a treatment program). Coders must be told prior to coding what the designated change goal is for the interaction. This should be designated on the coding form by the coder, before coding begins. This will allow coders to judge more accurately whether the clinician is directing interventions toward the change goal and evoking content from the client about it.

## GLOBAL SCORES

Global scores are intended to capture the rater's overall impression of how well or poorly the clinician meets the description of the dimension being measured. Although this may be accomplished by simultaneously evaluating many small elements, the rater's all­-at­-once judgment is paramount. The global scores should reflect the holistic evaluation of the interviewer, which cannot necessarily be separated into individual elements.

Global scores are assigned on a five­-point Likert scale, with a minimum of '1' and a maximum of '5.' The coder assumes a default score of '3' and moves up or down as indicated. A '3' may also reflect mixed practice. A '5' is generally not given when there are prominent examples of poor practice in the segment.

## Gloal Score - Empathy

This scale measures the extent to which the clinician understands or makes an effort to grasp the client’s perspective and experience (i.e., how much the clinician attempts to “try on” what the client feels or thinks). Empathy should not be confused with sympathy, warmth, acceptance, genuineness, support, or client advocacy; these are independent of the Empathy rating. Reflective listening is an important part of this characteristic, but this global rating is intended to capture all efforts that the clinician makes to understand the client’s perspective and convey that understanding to the client.

Clinicians high on the Empathy scale show evidence of understanding the client’s worldview in a variety of ways including complex reflections that seem to anticipate what clients mean but have not said, insightful questions based on previous listening and accurate appreciation for the client’s emotional state. Clinicians low on the Empathy scale do not appear interested in the client’s viewpoint.

The scoring criteria for Empathy global score five-point scale are as follows:

### Score of 1

1 - Clinician gives little or no attention to the client's perspective.

Examples:
- Asking only information-seeking questions
- Probing for factual information with no attempt to understand the client's perspective

### Score of 2

2 - Clinician makes sporadic efforts to explore the client's perspective. Clinician's understanding may be inaccurate or may detract from the client's true meaning.

Examples:
- Offers reflections but they often misinterpret what the client had said
- Displays shallow attempts to understand the client

### Score of 3

3 - Clinican is actively trying to understand the client's perspective, with modest success.

Examples:
- May offer a few accurate reflections, but may miss the client's point
- Makes an attempt to grasp the client's meaning throughout the session

### Score of 4

4 - Clinician makes active and repeated efforts to understand the client's point of view. Shows evidence of accurate understanding of the client's worldview, although mostly limited to explicit content.

Examples:
- Conveys interest in the client's perspective or situation
- Offers accurate reflections of what the client has said already
- Effectively communicates understanding of the client's viewpoint
- Expresses that the client's concerns or experiences are normal or similar to others'

### Score of 5

5 - Clinician shows evidence of deep understanding of client's point of view, not just for what has been explicitly stated but what the client means and has not said.

Examples:
- Effectively communicates an understanding of the client beyond what the client says in session
- Shows great interest in client's perspective or situation
- Attempts to 'put self in client's shoes'
- Often encourages client to elaborate, beyond what is necessary to merely follow the story
- Uses many accurate complex reflections

You are master therapist who is an expert in Motivational Interviewing. Using the reference above, wrapped in <reference> tags, provide a global score for Empathy based on the transcript wrapped in <transcript> tags. The transcript is provided in CSV format. The two important columns in each row are "P or C" and "Content of Utterance." The column "P or C" has a value of either "P" meaning "Provider" (the therapist) and C meaning "Client." The second column is the utterance made by the Provider or Client.
