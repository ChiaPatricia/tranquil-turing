## Purpose of the MITI

MITI is a behavioral coding system that assesses how well or how poorly a clinician is using motivational interviewing. It is intended to be used as a means of providing structured, formal feedback about ways to improve practice.

## COMPONENTS OF THE MITI

The MITI has two components: the global scores and the behavior counts.

A global score requires the coder to assign a single number from a five­-point scale to characterize an entire interaction. These scores are meant to capture the rater's global impression or overall judgment about the dimension, sometimes called the 'gestalt'. Four global dimensions are rated: Cultivating Change Talk, Softening Sustain Talk, Partnership, and Empathy. This means that each MITI review will contain four global scores.

A behavior count requires the coder to tally instances of particular interviewer behaviors. These running tallies occur from the beginning of the segment being reviewed until the end. The coder is not required to judge the overall quality of the event, as with global scores, but simply to count each instance of the behavior.

## DESIGNATING A CHANGE GOAL

An important feature of the MITI involves focusing on a particular change goal and maintaining a specific direction about that change within the conversation. Change goals, sometimes called target behaviors, may be very specific and behavioral (e.g., reducing drinking, monitoring blood sugar, engaging in a treatment program). Coders must be told prior to coding what the designated change goal is for the interaction. This should be designated on the coding form by the coder, before coding begins. This will allow coders to judge more accurately whether the clinician is directing interventions toward the change goal and evoking content from the client about it.

## GLOBAL SCORES

Global scores are intended to capture the rater's overall impression of how well or poorly the clinician meets the description of the dimension being measured. Although this may be accomplished by simultaneously evaluating many small elements, the rater's all­-at­-once judgment is paramount. The global scores should reflect the holistic evaluation of the interviewer, which cannot necessarily be separated into individual elements.

Global scores are assigned on a five­-point Likert scale, with a minimum of '1' and a maximum of '5.' The coder assumes a default score of '3' and moves up or down as indicated. A '3' may also reflect mixed practice. A '5' is generally not given when there are prominent examples of poor practice in the segment.

## Gloal Score - Cultivating Change Talk

This scale is intended to measure the extent to which the clinician actively encourages the client’s own language in favor of the change goal, and confidence for making that change. To achieve higher ratings on the Cultivating Change Talk scale, the change goal must be obvious in the session and the conversation must be largely focused on change, with the clinician actively cultivating change talk when possible. 

Low scores on this scale occur when the clinician is inattentive to the client’s language about change, either by failing to recognize and follow up on it, or by prioritizing other aspects of the interaction (such as history-­taking, assessment or non-­directive listening). Interactions low in Cultivating Change Talk may still be highly empathic and clinically appropriate.

The scoring criteria for Cultivating Change Talk global score five-point scale are as follows:

### Score of 1

1 - Clinician shows no explicit attention to, or preference for, the client's language in favor of changing.

Examples:
- Asks only for a history of the problem
- Structures the conversation to focus only on the problems the client is experiencing
- Shows no interest or concern for client values, strengths, hopes or past successes
- Provides education as only interaction with the client
- Supplies reasons for change rather than encouraging them from the client
- Ignores change talk when it is offered

### Score of 2

2 - Clinician sporadically attends to client language in favor of change - frequently misses opportunities to encourage change talk.

Examples:
- Superficial attention to client language about the change goal
- Fails to ask about potential benefits of change
- Lack of curiosity or minimal interest in client's values, strengths and past successes

### Score of 3

3 - Clinican often attends to the client's language in favor of change, but misses some opportunities to encourage change talk.

Examples:
- Misses opportunities to encourage client language in favor of change
- May give equal time and attention to sustain talk and change talk, for example using decisional balance after momentum for change is emerging

### Score of 4

4 - Clinician consistently attends to the client's language about change and makes efforts to encourage it.

Examples:
- More often than not, acknowledges client reasons for change and explores when they are offered
- Often responds to change talk with reflections that do not encourage deeper exploration from the client
- Expresses curiosity when clients offer change talk
- May explore client's values, strengths, hopes and past successes related to target goal

### Score of 5

5 - Clinician shows a marked and consistent effort to increase the depth, strength, or momentum of the client's language in favor of change.

Examples:
- Over a series of exchanges, the clinician shapes the client's language in favor of change
- Uses structured therapeutic tasks as a way of eliciting and reinforcing change talk
- Does not usually miss opportunities to build momentum of change talk
- Strategically elicits change talk and consistently responds to it when offered
- Rarely misses opportunities to build momentum of change talk
