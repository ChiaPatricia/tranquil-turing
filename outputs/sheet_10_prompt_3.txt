==================================================
Okay, I'm ready to provide feedback on the Partnership global score based on the transcript you provided.

Based on the transcript and the MITI Global Scores for Partnership, I would give this provider a **global score of 2 for Partnership.**

Here's my reasoning, drawing from the MITI descriptions and specific examples from the transcript:

**Score of 2 Justification:**

A score of 2 indicates that the "Clinician superficially responds to opportunities to collaborate."  This aligns with several aspects of the interaction:

* **Superficial Responses to Collaboration:**  While the provider does use reflections, they often feel more like a setup for the provider to then insert their own agenda or challenge the client's perspective, rather than genuinely exploring the client's viewpoint.  For example:

    * **Client:** "Yeah, you know I saw this DWI checkpoint from miles ahead and I wasn’t worried because I hadn’t been drinking."
    * **Provider:** "So you thought you were safe because you weren’t drinking."
    * **Client:** "Yeah, exactly."
    * **Provider:** "Had you been smoking pot that day?"

    Here, the reflection is accurate, but it immediately pivots to a closed question that directs the conversation toward the provider's agenda (exploring the client's substance use as a problem) rather than further exploring the client's initial statement about feeling safe.

* **Rarely Surrenders Expert Role:** The provider frequently adopts an expert stance, particularly by introducing studies and highlighting the negative consequences of pot use.  Examples include:

    * **Provider:** "Hmm. Alright, Alright. Well, you know there’s been a number of studies that have been done that have found that excessive pot use can have incredibly detrimental consequences."
    * **Provider:** "It does impair you though."
    * **Provider:** "Maybe you’re just not seeing it."

    These statements position the provider as the knowledgeable authority on the effects of marijuana, directly contradicting the client's self-assessment and experience.  The provider is primarily focused on educating and correcting the client's "misconceptions."

* **Minimal Querying of Client Input:**  While the provider asks questions, many are closed-ended or leading questions that don't genuinely invite the client's expertise or perspective on solutions or goals.  The questions often serve to challenge or direct the client rather than explore their inner wisdom.  For example:

    * **Provider:** "And you don’t consider that under the influence?" (This is a leading question that challenges the client's definition.)
    * **Provider:** "So you’re different from everybody else?" (This is a rhetorical and somewhat sarcastic question that minimizes the client's perspective.)
    * **Provider:** "Well, what do you make of the results of the studies, then?" (This question pushes the client to conform to the "expert" view.)
    * **Provider:** "Joe, do those things really have to happen to you? You’ve done so well for one week, don’t you think you can quit forever?" (This is a highly leading question that pushes for a specific outcome and minimizes the client's ambivalence.)

* **Sacrifices Opportunities for Mutual Problem Solving:** The conversation is dominated by the provider's attempts to convince the client of the negative consequences of pot use. There is very little evidence of mutual problem-solving or agenda setting. The session feels driven by the provider's pre-determined agenda rather than a collaborative exploration of the client's goals and values.

* **Righting Reflex:** The provider frequently exhibits the righting reflex, attempting to correct the client's perceptions and push him towards recognizing the need to change. This is evident in the examples above where the provider challenges the client's views on impairment and the severity of pot use.

**Why not a different score?**

* **Score of 1:** While the provider definitely takes an expert role and exhibits the righting reflex (characteristics of a 1), there are *some* reflections and attempts to engage with the client's statements, even if superficially. A score of 1 suggests a complete absence of collaboration, which isn't entirely the case here.
* **Score of 3:** A score of 3 indicates "Clinican incorporates client's contributions but does so in a lukewarm or erratic fashion." This score is too high because the incorporation of client contributions is minimal and primarily serves the provider's agenda.  The interaction doesn't feel "lukewarm" or "erratic" in its approach to partnership; it's consistently low in partnership throughout.
* **Scores of 4 or 5:** These scores are clearly not applicable as they describe clinicians who actively foster collaboration, power sharing, and genuinely negotiate the agenda and goals with the client. This transcript demonstrates the opposite.

**In summary, the provider in this transcript demonstrates a low level of Partnership, primarily operating from an expert role and exhibiting the righting reflex.  The interaction is characterized by superficial engagement with the client's perspective and a lack of genuine collaboration.  Therefore, a global score of 2 for Partnership is the most appropriate assessment.**

To improve their Partnership score, this provider would need to focus on:

* **Reducing the righting reflex:**  Resisting the urge to correct or persuade the client.
* **Deepening reflections:**  Using reflections to explore the client's perspective more fully, rather than as a setup for challenges.
* **Eliciting the client's agenda:**  Actively asking about and prioritizing what the client wants to discuss and achieve in the session.
* **Exploring the client's own wisdom and resources:**  Asking questions that draw out the client's own ideas and solutions.
* **Power sharing:**  Making it clear that the client is the expert on their own life and experiences, and that the therapist is there to support, not direct.

I hope this detailed feedback is helpful! Let me know if you have another transcript you'd like me to review.
