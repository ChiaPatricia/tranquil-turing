## Feedback on Partnership in Motivational Interviewing

Based on the transcript you provided and the MITI guidelines, here is a global score and feedback on the Partnership dimension:

**Global Score for Partnership: 4**

**Rationale:**

This therapist demonstrates good partnership skills, effectively fostering collaboration and shared decision-making throughout the interaction. Here's a breakdown of why a score of 4 is appropriate and specific examples from the transcript:

**Strengths demonstrating Partnership (leading to a score of 4):**

* **Negotiating the Agenda:** The therapist explicitly asks the client what they would like to focus on at the beginning of the session: *"First of all, we could talk about your test result, which I’ve got the result for... We could talk about your diet. We could talk about your exercise... or we could talk about anything else that you’d like to. Have you got a sense, if you think about those things, which of them you’d most like to talk about? What would you find helpful?"* This clearly invites the client to take the lead in directing the conversation and ensures the session addresses the client's priorities.
* **Soliciting Client's Perspective and Expertise:** The therapist consistently seeks the client's input and values their perspective as central to understanding and addressing the issue. Examples include:
    * *"How are you feeling at the moment and how are you feeling about your diabetes?"* - Openly invites the client's subjective experience.
    * *"So you know what you should be doing, but it’s not so easy to do it."* - Reflects understanding of the client's internal struggle.
    * *"How do I stop finding all the excuses to not go exercise?"* - The therapist directly responds to the client's stated goal.
    * *"So you feel that it’s something that it’s important for you to do"* - Checks understanding of client's motivation.
    * *"In what way? How would this improve your life? How do you see that?"* - Explores the client's own reasons for change.
    * *"Yeah. And I wonder what you think might be just the first small step that could help you through that barrier. Do you see what I’m saying?"* -  Invites client-generated solutions and checks for understanding.
    * *"It’s what makes sense to you that matters here."* - Explicitly validates the client's perspective as paramount.
* **Engaging in Problem-Solving Together:** The therapist and client work together to explore the barrier to exercise and potential solutions. The therapist doesn't dictate solutions but rather facilitates the client's own exploration and ideas.  The focus on "small steps" and reframing negative thoughts is co-constructed.
* **Avoiding the Righting Reflex:** The therapist largely avoids telling the client what to do or arguing for change.  Instead, they explore the client's ambivalence and barriers with curiosity and acceptance.
* **Summarizing and Checking Understanding:** The therapist regularly summarizes the conversation and checks with the client to ensure accurate understanding: *"let me just see if I can summarize what we’ve said today and see what you make of this. OK?"*, *"OK. OK. So you’ve more or less decided you want to do it, but you’re just not quite sure what it is yet. Have I got you?"*, *"Yes. You’ve got it perfect."* This demonstrates active listening and a commitment to understanding the client's perspective.

**Areas for Potential Growth (Moving towards a score of 5):**

* **Explicitly Naming Client Expertise:** While the therapist implicitly values the client's expertise, they could more explicitly state it. For example, phrases like *"You are the expert on your own experience with diabetes"* or *"You know yourself best, so your ideas about how to overcome this barrier are really important"* could further enhance partnership.
* **Deeper Exploration of Strengths and Resources:** While the conversation is positive and solution-focused, there could be a slightly stronger emphasis on explicitly exploring the client's existing strengths and resources related to managing their diabetes or other areas of their life.  This could further empower the client and reinforce their capacity for change.  For example, asking questions like *"What strengths have you drawn on in the past when you've made positive changes in your diet?"* or *"What resources do you already have in your life that might support you in becoming more active?"*

**Overall:**

This therapist demonstrates a strong commitment to partnership in this brief interaction. They effectively create a collaborative environment where the client's perspective is valued, and the agenda and potential solutions are co-constructed.  A score of 4 accurately reflects this strong performance, with minor suggestions for further refinement to reach a score of 5.  The therapist is well on their way to mastering the Partnership dimension of Motivational Interviewing.
