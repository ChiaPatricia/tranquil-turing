Sheet Number: 2
Prompt Number: 4
==================================================
Based on the transcript provided and the MITI guidelines for Cultivating Change Talk, I would give this interaction a global score of **3**.

Here's my reasoning, based on the MITI scoring criteria:

**Score of 3 Justification:**

* **"Clinician often attends to the client's language in favor of change, but misses some opportunities to encourage change talk."** This description best fits the interaction.

**Examples from the Transcript Supporting a Score of 3:**

* **Attends to Client Language:** The therapist frequently uses reflections, demonstrating active listening and attending to the client's perspective.  Examples include:
    * "I’m hearing you loud and clear that being here is not something that is really a high priority for you."
    * "So it seems to you like I might try to push you around and make you do a whole bunch of things you don’t want to do."
    * "You’re pretty fed up."
    * "So the fact that your daughter won’t even take your word for the fact that you won’t drink kind of bites at you a little bit."
    * "So it’s confusing to you why your drinking should cause a problem or everybody should be talking about that when you look around and you see that other people drink more than you do."
    * "So, it’s kind of the same thing you were saying before which is that it feels like everybody’s looking at your drinking but its just not as bad as everybody thinks it is."

* **Misses Opportunities to Encourage Change Talk:** While the therapist reflects well, there are missed opportunities to pivot towards exploring the *client's own reasons* for change and to evoke more change talk, especially in the earlier part of the conversation.
    * **Early Resistance:** The client expresses strong resistance. While reflecting this is important, the therapist could have more actively explored the *disadvantages* of the current situation or the *advantages* of change earlier on.  Instead, the therapist stays quite a while in the resistance.
    * **Focus on External Pressure:** The therapist acknowledges the client is there due to external pressure, which is accurate, but this could be followed up with questions that bridge to internal motivation. For example, after "You’re not here because you think you have a problem. You're here because they sent you here," the therapist could have asked something like, "And given that you *are* here, what, if anything, would make this time worthwhile for *you*?" or "Even though this wasn't your choice, are there any potential benefits *for you* in addressing the court's concerns?"
    * **Missed Opportunity with "Quit for a week or two":** When the client mentions "I think one time I quit for a week or two just to show people I could stop drinking," this is a potential opening for exploring past successes and confidence. The therapist's response "It almost sounds like you don’t even know whether you could stop even if you wanted to" is a bit more confrontational and less change-oriented. A more change-oriented response could have been, "So you *have* been able to stop for a week or two in the past. What was that like?" or "What did you learn about yourself when you stopped for that week or two?"
    * **Decisional Balance after Momentum:**  While not explicitly a decisional balance exercise, the therapist spends time exploring both the pros (relaxation, social aspects) and cons (legal trouble, family concerns) of drinking, but it's not strategically done to move towards change.  It feels more like exploring the client's current ambivalence without a clear direction to tip the balance towards change.

**Why not a higher score (4 or 5)?**

* **Not Consistently Encouraging:** The therapist is not consistently *shaping* the conversation towards change.  The session is more driven by the client's concerns and justifications, and the therapist primarily reflects these.
* **Lacks Strategic Elicitation:**  There isn't strong evidence of the therapist strategically using techniques to *elicit* and *deepen* change talk.  The therapist doesn't proactively use evocative questions, explore values related to change, or use techniques like rulers to assess importance or confidence in change.
* **Missed Opportunities to Build Momentum:**  While the therapist acknowledges the change talk that emerges towards the end, the session doesn't demonstrate a consistent effort to build momentum for change throughout the interaction.

**Why not a lower score (1 or 2)?**

* **Not Ignoring Change Talk:** The therapist does not ignore change talk when it is offered, especially towards the end of the session when the client starts expressing some concern about future consequences.
* **Not Providing Reasons for Change:** The therapist primarily avoids directly telling the client why he should change and instead focuses on reflecting the client's perspective.
* **Superficial Attention (Score of 2):** The therapist goes beyond superficial attention to the client's language and engages in deeper reflections and explorations of the client's experience.

**In summary,** the therapist demonstrates good reflective listening and empathy, which are foundational MI skills. However, the interaction could be improved by more proactively and strategically cultivating change talk throughout the session, especially in the earlier stages of addressing the client's resistance and ambivalence.  Therefore, a score of **3** for Cultivating Change Talk is the most accurate and helpful feedback in this case.
