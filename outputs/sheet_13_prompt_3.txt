==================================================
Based on the transcript provided and the MITI Global Scores for Partnership, I would give this interaction a global score of **1** for Partnership.

Here's my reasoning:

**Score: 1 - Clinician actively assumes the expert role for the majority of the interaction with the client. Collaboration or partnership is absent.**

**Justification based on the transcript and MITI description:**

* **"Explicitly takes the expert role by defining the problem, prescribing the goals, or laying out the plan of action"**:  The therapist immediately positions themselves as the expert and defines the problem.  Examples include:
    * **P: "So Randy you know at this treatment center we don’t treat bad luck. That’s not what we do here. And we don’t work for the judge. We work for people who want to change their lives. That’s what we’re about."** This statement clearly defines the therapist's agenda and what they believe is the "right" approach, dismissing the client's initial framing of the situation as "bad luck."
    * **P: "And I don’t work for the judge. I work for you."** While seemingly client-centered, in context, this is used to push the therapist's agenda of "change" and not necessarily the client's own goals.
    * **P: "If the shoe fits, fine."** This response to the client's question about admitting to being an alcoholic is dismissive and directive, implying the therapist knows what's best for the client.
    * **P: "Yeah, I think AA is a pretty good idea for you Randy actually. I think going to a few AA meetings would be an eye opener for you."** The therapist directly prescribes AA as the solution without exploring other options or the client's preferences in a collaborative way.
    * **P: "That’s my recommendation. So, as you mentioned before, it’s really up to the judge, what he would decide. That would be my recommendation."**  The therapist dictates the recommendation to the judge (90 AA meetings in 90 days) without any negotiation or client input on what might be feasible or acceptable for Randy.

* **"Clinician actively forces a particular agenda for the majority of the interaction with the client"**: The therapist's agenda is clearly focused on addressing Randy's drinking as a problem and pushing him towards acknowledging it and seeking treatment (specifically AA).  The entire conversation is steered towards this agenda, with minimal exploration of Randy's own perspective or goals beyond fulfilling the court mandate.

* **"Denies or minimizes client ideas"**: While not explicitly denying ideas, the therapist consistently minimizes or reframes Randy's statements to fit the therapist's expert perspective.
    * When Randy says, **C: "Well you know I just think it was kind of a fluke...the fact that I got busted I think was just bad luck."**, the therapist immediately counters with **P: "So Randy you know at this treatment center we don’t treat bad luck."** This dismisses Randy's perspective without exploration.
    * When Randy says, **C: "Yeah but you see I mean I don’t drink that much...this DUI was just a random thing."**, the therapist focuses on quantifying the amount of alcohol and highlighting the negative health consequences, rather than exploring Randy's perception of his drinking.
    * When Randy mentions his friends drinking more, **C: "Yeah but I drink less than any of my friends. All of my friends drink more than I do."**, the therapist reframes it to minimize Randy's point, **P: "So 50 beers a week sounds like a reasonable amount of alcohol for you to be drinking."** This is sarcastic and dismissive of Randy's attempt to normalize his drinking.

* **"Dominates conversation"**: The transcript shows the therapist taking longer turns and directing the flow of the conversation.  The therapist asks questions, but often to lead Randy to a predetermined conclusion rather than to genuinely understand his perspective.

* **"Often exhibits the righting reflex"**: The therapist frequently corrects, confronts, and argues against Randy's statements that minimize his drinking or deny a problem.  The therapist's focus is on "making things right" from their expert perspective, rather than exploring Randy's ambivalence.

**In summary,** the therapist in this transcript operates almost entirely from an expert role, directing the conversation, defining the problem, and prescribing solutions.  There is very little evidence of partnership, collaboration, or genuine exploration of Randy's own perspective, values, or goals.  Therefore, a score of **1** for Partnership is the most fitting assessment based on the MITI guidelines.
