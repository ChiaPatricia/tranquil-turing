## Purpose of the MITI

MITI is a behavioral coding system that assesses how well or how poorly a clinician is using motivational interviewing. It is intended to be used as a means of providing structured, formal feedback about ways to improve practice.

## COMPONENTS OF THE MITI

The MITI has two components: the global scores and the behavior counts.

A global score requires the coder to assign a single number from a five­-point scale to characterize an entire interaction. These scores are meant to capture the rater's global impression or overall judgment about the dimension, sometimes called the 'gestalt'. Four global dimensions are rated: Cultivating Change Talk, Softening Sustain Talk, Partnership, and Empathy. This means that each MITI review will contain four global scores.

A behavior count requires the coder to tally instances of particular interviewer behaviors. These running tallies occur from the beginning of the segment being reviewed until the end. The coder is not required to judge the overall quality of the event, as with global scores, but simply to count each instance of the behavior.

## DESIGNATING A CHANGE GOAL

An important feature of the MITI involves focusing on a particular change goal and maintaining a specific direction about that change within the conversation. Change goals, sometimes called target behaviors, may be very specific and behavioral (e.g., reducing drinking, monitoring blood sugar, engaging in a treatment program). Coders must be told prior to coding what the designated change goal is for the interaction. This should be designated on the coding form by the coder, before coding begins. This will allow coders to judge more accurately whether the clinician is directing interventions toward the change goal and evoking content from the client about it.

## GLOBAL SCORES

Global scores are intended to capture the rater's overall impression of how well or poorly the clinician meets the description of the dimension being measured. Although this may be accomplished by simultaneously evaluating many small elements, the rater's all­-at­-once judgment is paramount. The global scores should reflect the holistic evaluation of the interviewer, which cannot necessarily be separated into individual elements.

Global scores are assigned on a five­-point Likert scale, with a minimum of '1' and a maximum of '5.' The coder assumes a default score of '3' and moves up or down as indicated. A '3' may also reflect mixed practice. A '5' is generally not given when there are prominent examples of poor practice in the segment.

## Gloal Score - Cultivating Change Talk

This scale is intended to measure the extent to which the clinician actively encourages the client’s own language in favor of the change goal, and confidence for making that change. To achieve higher ratings on the Cultivating Change Talk scale, the change goal must be obvious in the session and the conversation must be largely focused on change, with the clinician actively cultivating change talk when possible.

Low scores on this scale occur when the clinician is inattentive to the client’s language about change, either by failing to recognize and follow up on it, or by prioritizing other aspects of the interaction (such as history-­taking, assessment or non-­directive listening). Interactions low in Cultivating Change Talk may still be highly empathic and clinically appropriate.

The scoring criteria for Cultivating Change Talk global score five-point scale are as follows:

### Score of 1

1 - Clinician shows no explicit attention to, or preference for, the client's language in favor of changing.

Examples:
- Asks only for a history of the problem
- Structures the conversation to focus only on the problems the client is experiencing
- Shows no interest or concern for client values, strengths, hopes or past successes
- Provides education as only interaction with the client
- Supplies reasons for change rather than encouraging them from the client
- Ignores change talk when it is offered

### Score of 2

2 - Clinician sporadically attends to client language in favor of change - frequently misses opportunities to encourage change talk.

Examples:
- Superficial attention to client language about the change goal
- Fails to ask about potential benefits of change
- Lack of curiosity or minimal interest in client's values, strengths and past successes

### Score of 3

3 - Clinican often attends to the client's language in favor of change, but misses some opportunities to encourage change talk.

Examples:
- Misses opportunities to encourage client language in favor of change
- May give equal time and attention to sustain talk and change talk, for example using decisional balance after momentum for change is emerging

### Score of 4

4 - Clinician consistently attends to the client's language about change and makes efforts to encourage it.

Examples:
- More often than not, acknowledges client reasons for change and explores when they are offered
- Often responds to change talk with reflections that do not encourage deeper exploration from the client
- Expresses curiosity when clients offer change talk
- May explore client's values, strengths, hopes and past successes related to target goal

### Score of 5

5 - Clinician shows a marked and consistent effort to increase the depth, strength, or momentum of the client's language in favor of change.

Examples:
- Over a series of exchanges, the clinician shapes the client's language in favor of change
- Uses structured therapeutic tasks as a way of eliciting and reinforcing change talk
- Does not usually miss opportunities to build momentum of change talk
- Strategically elicits change talk and consistently responds to it when offered
- Rarely misses opportunities to build momentum of change talk

     C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Well, yeah, the doctor thought it would be a good idea – I’m not, I don’t know but
     P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Yeah your doctor spoke with me and I’m wondering if it would be ok with you if I share some of the information that he talked about
     C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Well yeah, I guess, I mean he talked to me too but I guess, yeah, what did he tell you?
     P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Sure, well why don’t we make sure we’re on the same page. So he indicated to me that he’s a little bit concerned about how much you’re drinking and thought it might be helpful if you and I just talk a little bit and see what’s been going on. Does that work for you?
     C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Well yeah, I mean you know it’s not, it’s not really, I don’t believe it’s the drinking that’s really the problem, it’s my, you know, I’m having some stomach problems.
     P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Right right. So you don’t see the drinking as the cause of all this. You think, you know, you’re having this stomach issue and the drinking’s not really related.
     C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Yeah, I actually think that it’s probably more related to both the stress that I have going on and what I’ve been eating. And you know I think there must be something that I’m eating... I know other people who had that kind of problem and you know rather than the drinking, cause I just don’t drink that much
     P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Right, right, well I’m not a medical doctor, you know, I don’t know all the ins and outs but if it’s ok with can I talk to you a little bit about what he shared specifically in terms of how much you were drinking and then some norms, people in terms of their drinking – how much they drink- would that be okay if we talk about that for a moment?
     C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Okay
     P                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Okay, so your doctor indicated to me that he’s pretty worried actually about your drinking and what he said to me was that it looks like you might be drinking about six drinks a day, and that, you know, some of the assessments you filled out - it looks like about six drinks a day. Now, do you remember talking to him about this or that’s what you *( inaudible) in terms of your drinking
     C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Well, you know, I mean, I’m drink – you know, I’m not, I don’t know, he asked me about how much you know and I, you know, pretty much said I kinda have a, you know, usually have a bottle of wine every day. But I, you know, I don’t, he didn’t ask me, he didn’t say anything about six I mean I just, you know, it’s just like one bottle

There’s something called the...these guidelines that NIAAA, which is just organization has, in terms in how much people should drink. I don’t know if you’ve heard of these or if you are familiar with them at all.

Does that, how does that fit with your current drinking right now?

     P                                                                                                                           Right so your numbers don’t necessarily match up with his. Well, I mean I can tell you that regardless of the exact numbers you know I think his concern is that your drinking is quite a bit more than what is recommended and you know six drinks per day or four drinks per day, it doesn’t really matter how much, it puts, generally puts people at risk for a number of health problems, sometimes legal problems, social problems and so I think that’s why he wanted me to talk with you a bit.

I do it at home and, you know, I don’t see any, you know, I’m not having problems with my family or anything other than my, you know, I’m having stress related to my teenagers. I’ve got one that’s really acting up and it’s causing me a lot of stress so you know I know I’m drinking more than I used to drink but you know or did a coupla years ago but it’s just because there’s so much stress

I guess if it’s causing, if it has to do with my, you know, stomach – I am really worried about what’s going on with my stomach cause it’s pretty painful

I mean I do know that that’s more than is, you know, that’s not good for me

I mean I should be able to just, I should be able to reduce that I guess but it’s hard for me to imagine not being able to, to do it, you know I mean it’s just, otherwise the anxiety’s just gonna bowl me over, you know

Drinking is...so it’s something that you do in a lot of ways to cope with some of the stress you’ve got going on. And it sounds like you’re working really hard and you have a lot going on with your kids and that you’re trying to be the best mom that you can be to them and drinking has made a lot of that easier for you

Right. No, that makes a lot of sense. You have a lot going on and that’s been a way for you to cope and I can see that. So on the one hand, you know, drinking is – you’re worried about what it’s doing to your stomach and you’re worried about the possible health consequences of it. On the other hand it’s a big part of your life and helping you get through some difficult times.

Well, would it be all right if I give you, you know, some ideas about how to possibly cut back on your drinking?

     P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              So it sounds like you’re drinking anywhere from 4 to 6 drinks a night and really we don’t want people drinking more than a glass of wine , so really you shouldn’t be drinking more than a glass of wine a day or more than 7 drinks a week. So, you know, there’s lots of ways people can cut back, but what does that, how does that sound to you?

That’d get me through dinner.

So making some changes seems like it would work for you but you’re not willing to cut back all the way to one

I guess, you know, it should help my stomach, though, if I cut back even a little bit, shouldn’t it, if it really is doing, if it’s causing some of the problem?
     P   Yeah, I mean cutting back is always better, right? And you know I think your doctor was pretty firm that he would really like you to cut back possibly, what he said to me is “I’ll take a third” cause he’s worried your continued drinking affecting your stomach and that what he thought was going on was that it was kind of tearing up the lining of your stomach so that any alcohol, caffeine, coffee that kind of thing, that could all potentially cause you problems. But it sounds like that doesn’t, like it’s not going to work. That you’re not willing to cut back to one or you know, quit drinking altogether

Yeah, coffee too? Man he didn’t talk to me about that

And yeah, I think he was worried about taking away it all for you at once, but you know...

You know sometimes I have patients who find other things or other ways to relax and they start doing those at about the time they started drinking or beforehand and that helps them, you know, have something else to occupy their time when they would typically start drinking. So that might be something for you to consider.

I run them around I do all the things I’m supposed to do to take care of them, so, you know, I mean I guess if I really got sick then I wouldn’t be able to do it, but I’ve been able to work through, you know how we women we have to work through everything. You don’t get to be sick
     P No (*inaudible) and you’re doing a great job of it and it’s sounds like you have an important role in your family. It also sounds like you have a lot going on and that, you know, there might be other ways to deal with some of the stress other than relying on the drinking. But this again, it has to be your choice. You know, I can tell you that, you know, your doctor does think that some of these stomach problems may be linked back to the drinking, but you know what I’m not a medical provider and you know, I think ultimately you’re the one that gets to make the decision about how you proceed with things.

 </transcript>

Based on the transcript provided and using the MITI Global Score - Cultivating Change Talk criteria, I would give this interaction a global score of **2** for Cultivating Change Talk.

Here's my reasoning, drawing from the MITI score descriptions:

**Score Justification:**

* **Sporadic Attention to Change Talk (Score 2):** The therapist demonstrates some awareness of the change goal (reducing drinking) and occasionally acknowledges the client's language that hints at change. For example, when the client says, "Yeah, I guess, I mean I you know I mean I do know that I shouldn’t be drinking a bottle of wine every day," the therapist responds with "Right right. You can see the problems that might cause or even has caused drinking at that level." This shows the therapist is *hearing* the client's statement about potential change.

* **Frequently Misses Opportunities to Encourage Change Talk (Score 2):**  This is the primary reason for the score of 2.  Throughout the session, the client offers several openings for exploring change talk that are missed or not fully developed by the therapist.

    * **Example 1:** When the client says, "I should be able to just, I should be able to reduce that I guess," this is a clear invitation to explore her "shoulds" and "coulds" regarding reducing drinking.  Instead of exploring *her* reasons or confidence in reducing, the therapist reflects back "Drinking is...so it’s something that you do in a lot of ways to cope with some of the stress you’ve got going on." While empathic, this reflection focuses on sustain talk (coping with stress) rather than deepening the emerging change talk about reducing.

    * **Example 2:**  Later, when the client suggests reducing to "half a bottle, maybe two drinks," the therapist acknowledges this and asks "So making some changes seems like it would work for you but you’re not willing to cut back all the way to one."  While acknowledging the client's idea, the therapist immediately pivots back to the *unwillingness* to cut back to one, reinforcing sustain talk rather than exploring the client's rationale for the "two drinks" idea and potentially building on that.

    * **Example 3:** The therapist provides a lot of information about drinking guidelines and the doctor's concerns. While information can be part of MI, in this transcript, it feels more like "supplying reasons for change rather than encouraging them from the client" (Score 1 example).  The therapist focuses on external motivators (doctor's worry, guidelines) rather than eliciting the client's *own* internal motivations for change.

* **Lack of Curiosity about Client's Values, Strengths, and Past Successes (Score 2):**  The therapist touches on values briefly at the very end ("It sounds like you really value being a good mother"), but this is late in the session and not directly linked to the change goal of reducing drinking.  There's no exploration of the client's strengths or past successes that could be leveraged to support change.

**Why not a Score of 1?**

The therapist is not completely ignoring change talk. They do acknowledge it when it surfaces.  A score of 1 would be more appropriate if the therapist consistently steered away from any change-oriented statements or only focused on problem history and assessment.

**Why not a Score of 3?**

While the therapist does "often attend" to the *topic* of change (because it's the reason for the referral), they don't "often attend to the client's *language* in favor of change" in a way that actively encourages and deepens it.  A score of 3 suggests more consistent attention to change talk and just missing *some* opportunities. In this transcript, the missed opportunities are more frequent and impactful, hindering the cultivation of stronger change talk.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

To improve their Cultivating Change Talk score, the therapist could focus on:

* **Recognizing and Responding to Change Talk More Actively:**  When the client offers any statement that leans towards change (desire, ability, reasons, need, commitment), the therapist should immediately seize that opportunity to explore it further.  For example, with "I should be able to reduce that I guess," the therapist could have asked: "What makes you say 'should'? What are some reasons you might want to reduce your drinking?" or "If you decided to reduce, what do you think you'd be able to do?"
* **Eliciting Client's Own Reasons for Change:** Instead of primarily providing information and external reasons, the therapist should ask more evocative questions to draw out the client's personal motivations.  Questions like: "What are some things you'd like to be different in your life related to your drinking?" or "What are your hopes for your health and well-being?"
* **Exploring Values and Goals:** Connecting the change goal to the client's underlying values (like being a good mother, managing stress, health) can strengthen motivation. The therapist started to touch on values at the end, but this could be integrated earlier and more deeply.
* **Building Confidence:**  While not explicitly measured in "Cultivating Change Talk" alone, exploring confidence (or lack thereof) in making changes is crucial in MI.  The therapist could ask: "How confident do you feel right now that you could make some changes to your drinking if you decided to?" and then explore any confidence talk that emerges.

By shifting from primarily information-giving and problem-focused discussion to a more evocative and exploratory approach that centers the client's own motivations and change language, the therapist can significantly improve their ability to cultivate change talk.
