  "global_score_empathy": 4,
  "feedback_empathy": "Based on the transcript provided, I would give a global score of 4 for Empathy. \n\n**Rationale for the score of 4:**\n\nThe therapist demonstrates 'active and repeated efforts to understand the client's point of view.' Throughout the conversation, the therapist consistently uses reflections to check their understanding of the client's experience and perspective.  Here are some examples:\n\n*   **Reflecting Feelings of Being Forced and Unfairness:** The therapist accurately reflects the client's initial feelings of being forced to attend and feeling unfairly singled out by the company. Examples include: 'So you are feeling kind of forced to come in,' and 'So it feels like you kind of got singled out. That it’s really not fair.'\n*   **Reflecting Sense of Injustice and Company Overreach:** The therapist captures the client's feeling that the company is overstepping its boundaries by saying, 'So even if what happened with the drug test is right, it still doesn’t feel like it is the right thing. It’s like the company doesn’t have the right to do that.'\n*   **Acknowledging Ambivalence and Conflicting Feelings:** The therapist reflects the client's mixed feelings about his job and the situation, showing an understanding of the client's dilemma: 'Yeah. And it doesn’t feel right and yet, you know, you really appreciate having the job. As you said, it is hard to find a job these days and you also really ... it pays well and you’ve been a solid, good employee for a long time. And without any accidents.'\n*   **Reflecting Concerns about the Process and Therapist's Role:** The therapist addresses the client's concerns about being 'forced into more' and the therapist's potential self-interest, demonstrating an understanding of the client's mistrust and apprehension: 'It sounds like you’re a little concerned that we may just be trying to force you into more or taking more or jumping through hoops in order to be able to get through it,' and 'So, we might even be, it feels like we might even be ... have an investment in keeping you here longer or keeping you back a little in order to, you know, sort of ... for our own purposes.'\n*   **Reflecting Ambivalence about Change:** The therapist accurately reflects the client's torn feelings about stopping marijuana use and the potential difficulties and uncertainties associated with it: 'So you kind of feel torn about it. Like maybe, maybe I might have to stop, stop doing this, at least for the time being, so I can get through this ... and yet that feels a little scary. Like I’m not sure I really want to do this or that that the alternatives are going to be better.'\n\nThese examples show that the therapist is actively listening and making a concerted effort to understand the client's perspective. The reflections are generally accurate and communicate an understanding of the client's explicit concerns and feelings. \n\n**Areas for Potential Growth (Moving towards a score of 5):**\n\nTo move towards a score of 5, the therapist could consider incorporating more complex reflections that anticipate what the client might mean but hasn't explicitly stated. While the therapist does a good job of reflecting the explicit content, there are fewer examples of reflections that delve into deeper, unstated emotions or perspectives. \n\nFor instance, when the client mentions his friend Tommy's experience, the therapist could have explored the client's underlying fear and anxiety more deeply.  Instead of just saying 'Yeah,' the therapist could have reflected something like: 'It sounds like Tommy's experience has you really worried that you might get caught in a similar situation, feeling stuck and controlled by this process, even if you feel you don't need to be here.' This type of reflection starts to move beyond the explicit story and taps into the potential underlying emotional concerns.\n\nOverall, the therapist demonstrates good empathy skills, effectively communicating understanding and creating a space for the client to express their perspective. Focusing on incorporating more complex reflections that explore unstated emotions and meanings could further enhance the therapist's empathy skills towards a score of 5."
