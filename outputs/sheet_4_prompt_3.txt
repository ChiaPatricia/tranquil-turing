==================================================
Based on the transcript provided and the MITI Global Score descriptions for Partnership, I would give this interaction a global score of **2** for Partnership.

Here's my reasoning, drawing from the transcript and the MITI guidelines for a score of 2:

**Score of 2: Clinician superficially responds to opportunities to collaborate.**

**Examples from the transcript that support a score of 2:**

* **Superficial response to client input:**  When the client states "It’s a bunch of bullshit," in response to the doctor's recommendation to quit smoking, the therapist acknowledges it with "Right. OK." but quickly pivots to explaining *their* role and agenda ("heart of my job is to do whatever I can to help people gather the information they need...to look to the future, consider a quit date, and go for it.").  This response minimizes the client's strong reaction and redirects the conversation back to the therapist's pre-determined path.  A more collaborative approach would have been to explore *why* the client feels it's "bullshit," showing curiosity about the client's perspective.

* **Rarely surrenders the expert role:** The therapist frequently takes on the role of educator and advisor.  They explain the links between smoking and surgery, the benefits of quitting, and the availability of aids.  Phrases like "I must say that...", "really the heart of my job is...", "obviously before you choose a quit date...", "So that’s quite a lot of information I’m giving you..." all position the therapist as the expert with knowledge to impart.

* **Minimal querying of client input:** While the therapist asks "What do you think about that?" initially, subsequent questions are often closed-ended or leading, such as "are you clear about the links between smoking and health?" and "Do you see what I mean?" These questions are more about checking if the client is absorbing the therapist's information rather than genuinely exploring the client's own understanding, motivations, or ideas.

* **Sacrifices opportunities for mutual problem solving in favor of supplying knowledge or expertise:** The interaction is heavily weighted towards the therapist providing information and direction.  There is little to no evidence of the therapist engaging the client in mutual problem-solving, brainstorming, or exploring the client's own resources or strengths related to change.  The focus is on the therapist's agenda of smoking cessation and the "stages" of their program.

* **Minimal responses to client's potential agenda items, knowledge, idea, and/or concerns:** The client expresses skepticism about the link between smoking and his current situation ("I’m not really convinced that it was my smoking that’s put me in the situation I’m in today, so I’m just going through the motions.").  While the therapist acknowledges the injury was sport-related, they quickly pivot back to the smoking issue and its interference with recovery, rather than exploring the client's skepticism or "going through the motions" statement further.

**In summary,** the therapist in this transcript demonstrates some initial politeness and asks an open question, but quickly defaults to an expert-driven approach. They provide information, set the agenda, and direct the conversation towards smoking cessation without genuinely exploring the client's perspective, concerns, or potential for collaboration. This pattern aligns most closely with a Partnership score of **2**.

**To improve Partnership, the therapist could:**

* **Explore the client's "bullshit" statement:**  Instead of moving past it, ask open-ended questions to understand why the client feels this way.  For example, "Tell me more about why it feels like bullshit," or "What are your thoughts about what Dr. Ross said?"
* **Elicit the client's understanding of the risks:** Instead of *telling* the client about the risks, ask questions like, "What are your own thoughts about the health risks of smoking?" or "What have you heard about the connection between smoking and surgery recovery?"
* **Negotiate the agenda:**  After the initial introductions, explicitly ask the client what *they* would like to get out of the session.  "What would be most helpful for you to talk about today?" or "What are your hopes for our conversation?"
* **Focus on client's expertise:** Acknowledge the client as the expert on their own life and experiences.  Ask about their past experiences with health changes, their own ideas about what might be helpful, and their strengths and resources.
* **Reduce advice-giving and information-dumping:**  Shift from telling to asking.  Instead of providing information about aids, ask "What, if anything, do you already know about aids to quit smoking?" and build from there based on the client's existing knowledge and interest.

By shifting from an expert-driven approach to a more collaborative and client-centered style, the therapist can significantly improve their Partnership score and more effectively engage the client in the change process.
