Prompt Number: 3
==================================================
Based on the transcript provided and the <reference> material for the MITI Global Score - Partnership, I would give this interaction a **global score of 4 for Partnership.**

Here's my reasoning, drawing from the descriptions of each score level and examples from the transcript:

**Why not a lower score (1, 2, or 3)?**

* **Not a 1 or 2:** The therapist is clearly *not* dominating the conversation, forcing an agenda, or acting as the sole expert.  The therapist consistently reflects the client's feelings and perspectives, showing they are listening and trying to understand the client's experience.  There's no evidence of the "righting reflex" or arguing with the client.
* **Not a 3:** While a score of 3 indicates incorporating client contributions in a "lukewarm or erratic fashion," this therapist is more consistent and intentional in their collaborative approach. They don't just passively accept client input; they actively solicit it and use it to guide the conversation.  The interaction is more of a "dance" than a "stand-off."

**Why a score of 4?**

A score of 4 indicates that the "Clinician fosters collaboration and power sharing so that client's contributions impact the session in ways that they otherwise would not."  This accurately describes the interaction.

Here are specific examples from the transcript that support a score of 4:

* **Soliciting Client's Perspective and Agenda:**
    * **P:** "Hi Mike... why don’t you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today." -  Open invitation for the client to start where they are.
    * **P:** "Yeah, yeah. So given that you don’t want to be here, what do you think, what would be helpful for you? ... What would you like to do?" - Directly asks the client about their needs and preferences, acknowledging their resistance and inviting them to shape the session.
    * **P:** "Well, what is your understanding about what it’s going to take for you to get in, you know what if they told you ... what is the policy you know of..." -  Checks the client's understanding and knowledge, valuing their perspective.
    * **P:** "Yeah. How can I help you with this process? ... what do you think; how can I help you?" - Explicitly asks for client input on how the therapist can be helpful.
    * **P:** "Well, I’m certainly willing to work with you to figure out how to get you through this as fast as possible and get you into where you feel good about your work. So, what do you think; shall we work together to do this?" -  Directly proposes collaboration and seeks agreement from the client.

* **Reflecting and Validating Client's Experience:** The therapist consistently reflects the client's feelings of being forced, unfairly treated, and concerns about his job and privacy. This demonstrates understanding and empathy, building partnership by showing the client they are heard. Examples include: "So you are feeling kind of forced to come in," "So it feels like you kind of got singled out. That it’s really not fair," "Yeah. And it doesn’t feel right and yet, you know, you really appreciate having the job."

* **Addressing Client's Concerns about Power Imbalance:** The therapist directly addresses the client's concern about the therapist's potential self-interest and lack of client control:
    * **P:** "And I want to assure you that there is nothing that I can do, that we can do, to force you into one way or another. The decisions that you make about each step, each step that you go really are up to you." -  Explicitly clarifies client autonomy and reduces the power imbalance.
    * **P:** "Would it be alright if I shared a little about what my role is and what I might be able to offer you and what my relationship with your work is?" - Seeks permission and offers transparency about their role, further building trust and partnership.
    * **P:** "It’s not up to me to say, tell you what to do. It’s up to us to work together to come up with something that will work for you." -  Clearly defines a collaborative approach and rejects the expert role.

**Why not a score of 5?**

While the therapist demonstrates strong partnership skills, a score of 5 is reserved for interactions where the "client's contributions substantially influence the nature of the session."  In this transcript, while the therapist is responsive to the client and seeks their input, the session is still largely driven by the intake context and the employer's referral.

To reach a score of 5, the therapist might have:

* **More explicitly negotiated the agenda at the very beginning.**  While the therapist asks "what brings you in," they could have more directly asked "What would be most helpful for you to talk about today, given you are here because of your employer?" to more actively negotiate the session's focus from the outset.
* **More deeply explored the client's strengths and resources.** While the therapist acknowledges the client's job history, there isn't a strong focus on strengths and resources as described in the score 5 criteria.
* **Facilitated client evaluation of options and planning more explicitly.** While the therapist offers to "work together to come up with something that will work for you," the transcript doesn't show a deep dive into exploring various options and having the client evaluate them.

**In summary, a score of 4 for Partnership is a strong and accurate reflection of this interaction. The therapist demonstrates a clear commitment to collaboration, power sharing, and valuing the client's perspective, making it a good example of Partnership in Motivational Interviewing.**
