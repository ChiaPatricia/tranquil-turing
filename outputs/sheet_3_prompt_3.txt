Sheet Number: 3
Prompt Number: 3
==================================================
Based on the transcript provided and the MITI Global Scores for Partnership, I would give this interaction a global score of **4** for Partnership.

Here's my reasoning, drawing from the descriptions of each score level and examples from the transcript:

**Why not a lower score (1, 2, or 3)?**

* **Not a 1 or 2:** The therapist is clearly *not* taking on an expert role and dominating the conversation.  The therapist is not prescribing goals or laying out a plan of action.  Instead, the therapist is primarily listening, reflecting, and asking open-ended questions to understand the client's perspective.  There's no evidence of the "righting reflex" or arguing with the client.
* **Not a 3:** While a score of 3 indicates incorporating client contributions in a "lukewarm or erratic fashion," this therapist is consistently and genuinely engaging with the client's input.  The interaction is not a "stand-off." The therapist is actively trying to understand the client's perspective and build upon it.

**Why a score of 4?**

A score of 4 describes a clinician who "fosters collaboration and power sharing so that client's contributions impact the session in ways that they otherwise would not."  This accurately describes the interaction in the transcript.

* **Structuring for Client Input:** The therapist starts with an open-ended question ("tell me a little about what brings you here today") and consistently uses reflections and open questions to solicit the client's views and experiences. This structures the session to prioritize client input.
* **Searching for Agreement:** The therapist implicitly seeks agreement on the problem definition.  Initially, the referral is framed as a "parenting skills class," but the therapist quickly shifts to understanding the client's *own* perception of the issue – his frustration with the social worker, his desire to be a better father, his concerns about discipline, and his wish for respect from his son.
* **Soliciting Client Views More Than Perfunctorily:** The therapist's reflections are not just superficial acknowledgements. They are thoughtful summaries that demonstrate deep listening and encourage the client to elaborate further.  Examples include:
    * *"Hmm. The interaction you had with her – you ended up with a feeling like she thought you were an abusive father, and particularly she wasn’t picking up on the fact that you’ve made a lot of efforts to be a good Dad."* This reflection goes beyond simply repeating the client's words and captures the emotional core of his statement.
    * *"On the one hand, you want to improve the way you are with him, and you don’t want to be so physical in your punishment, but on the other hand you don’t want him to be weak, and you don’t want him to be disrespectful."* This reflection summarizes complex and potentially conflicting desires expressed by the client, showing careful listening and synthesis.
* **Engaging Client in Problem Solving/Brainstorming:**  When the client expresses interest in learning new discipline methods, the therapist asks, *"Well, what thoughts have you had about different ways that you might discipline your child...?"* This directly invites the client to contribute his own ideas and potential solutions.
* **Not Directing When Client Pushes Back:** When the client expresses reservations about women being in the class and prefers a men's group, the therapist doesn't argue or dismiss this. Instead, the therapist reflects and validates the client's concern: *"So one thing that would make it easier to come to a place like this is if you felt that it wasn’t all about the way women do things with children."*  This demonstrates respect for the client's perspective even when it differs from the program's structure.
* **Not Insisting on Resolution:** The therapist doesn't push the client to immediately commit to the class, especially given his reservations. The therapist explores his concerns and willingness to "give it a try," respecting the client's pace.

**Why not a score of 5?**

While the therapist demonstrates excellent partnership skills, a score of 5 represents the highest level of power sharing where the "client's contributions substantially influence the nature of the session" and the therapist "genuinely negotiates the agenda and goals."

In this transcript, while the therapist is highly collaborative, the initial agenda is somewhat set by the referral for a parenting class.  A score of 5 might be more appropriate if the therapist had explicitly negotiated the session's agenda with the client at the very beginning, asking something like, "What would be most helpful for you to talk about today regarding parenting?" and then fully following the client's lead.

However, within the context of the referral, the therapist maximizes partnership by deeply exploring the client's perspective, values, and ideas, and by adapting the conversation to address the client's specific concerns and preferences.  Therefore, a score of 4 is a strong and accurate reflection of the therapist's skillful application of partnership principles in this interaction.

**In summary, the therapist consistently demonstrates behaviors aligned with a Partnership score of 4 by:**

* **Prioritizing client perspective and expertise.**
* **Actively listening and reflecting to ensure understanding.**
* **Using open-ended questions to explore client's ideas and goals.**
* **Validating client's concerns and preferences.**
* **Avoiding expert role and directive advice.**
* **Facilitating client-driven exploration of solutions.**

Therefore, a **global score of 4 for Partnership** is a well-justified and appropriate assessment of this therapist's skills based on the provided transcript and MITI guidelines.
