==================================================
Based on the transcript provided and the MITI Global Score - Empathy descriptions, I would give this therapist a global score of **1** for Empathy.

**Rationale:**

**Score of 1 Description:** "Clinician gives little or no attention to the client's perspective."

**Evidence from the Transcript:**

* **Lack of Exploration of Client's Perspective:**  Throughout the conversation, the therapist (P) primarily focuses on explaining the company policy, the requirements of the treatment program, and the negative consequences of marijuana use.  There is minimal to no genuine curiosity or exploration of the client's (C) perspective, feelings, or experiences.
* **Dismissal of Client's Feelings:** When the client expresses frustration ("I wish I understood why I have to be here right now," "Well I, you know, get a little frustrated..."), the therapist acknowledges it superficially ("Yeah I hear that a lot; I mean that’s the way a lot of people feel") but immediately pivots back to the company's perspective and policy ("But the bottom line is ... that’s the policies and procedures of your workplace"). This dismisses the client's feelings as common and unimportant rather than exploring them.
* **Information-Seeking and Directive Questions:** The therapist's questions are primarily information-seeking ("What did you do?", "Well, how much do you smoke?") and directive ("Shall I make you an appointment?"). These questions serve to gather information for the program or to move the client towards compliance, not to understand the client's inner world.
* **Absence of Reflection:**  There are virtually no reflective statements in the therapist's responses.  The therapist does not attempt to reflect back the client's feelings of frustration, unfairness, or discomfort.  Instead, the therapist often reinterprets or redirects the client's statements to fit the agenda of program enrollment and policy enforcement.
* **Judgmental and Assumptive Statements:**  Statements like "Well, you know that is something, when somebody is impaired, that ... and marijuana is particularly bad for that," and "clearly you would have given it up already if you weren’t having some serious problems with it" are judgmental and based on assumptions about the client's motivations and experiences, rather than an attempt to understand them from the client's point of view.

**In summary, the therapist in this transcript demonstrates very little to no attention to the client's perspective. The interaction is dominated by information-giving, policy explanation, and subtle pressure to comply with the treatment program.  The therapist misses multiple opportunities to explore the client's feelings and understand their experience.  Therefore, a global score of 1 for Empathy is the most fitting assessment based on the MITI criteria.**

**Feedback for the Therapist:**

To improve empathy, the therapist should focus on actively listening to the client's concerns and reflecting back their understanding of the client's perspective.  Here are some specific suggestions based on this transcript:

* **When the client expresses frustration at the beginning ("I wish I understood why I have to be here right now"), a more empathetic response would be to reflect that feeling:**  "It sounds like you're feeling confused and maybe a bit frustrated about being here today. Is that right?" or "It's understandable that you'd want to know why this is happening. It sounds like you're feeling unsure about the whole situation."
* **When the client talks about the perceived unfairness of the drug testing ("I feel like people make errors at work all the time... and they don’t get drug tested, but I just got chosen"), the therapist could reflect the feeling of unfairness:** "It sounds like you feel singled out and that this feels unfair, especially since you see mistakes happen to others without the same consequences."
* **Instead of immediately dismissing the client's feelings as common ("Yeah, and I hear that a lot too where people in your situation feel like they are picked out and ... but that’s just not the case"), the therapist could validate the feeling before gently redirecting, if necessary:** "I can see why it would feel that way, like you're being singled out.  It's tough when policies feel personal.  And while it is policy, it's still understandable to feel that way. Let's talk more about what that feels like for you."
* **Use more complex reflections that go beyond the surface content:**  For example, when the client says "Yeah, but you know, I’ve never smoked marijuana at work or before work ...", instead of immediately asking "Well, how much do you smoke?", the therapist could reflect the client's defensiveness and perhaps underlying concern: "So it sounds like you're really wanting to make it clear that your marijuana use hasn't affected your work, and that's important to you that I understand that."

By focusing on reflective listening, exploring the client's perspective, and validating their feelings, the therapist can significantly improve their empathy and move towards a higher MITI Empathy score.
