  "justification": "The global score for Cultivating Change Talk is **4**. \n\n**Justification:**\nThe therapist in this transcript demonstrates consistent attention to the client's language about change and makes clear efforts to encourage it.  For example, when the client mentions past success with weight loss and reduced alcohol consumption (C8), the therapist immediately affirms this and frames it positively, saying \"You were ahead of the game and didnâ€™t even know it!\" (P9). This reinforces the client's past positive behaviors related to the change goal.\n\nThe therapist also consistently uses open-ended questions to explore the client's understanding and potential solutions, such as \"Earlier you mentioned that you thought there were other things that you could do besides the medication to help. What have you heard about? What have you read about?\" (P7) and \"What else have you heard about?\" (P11). These questions invite the client to explore change options.\n\nFurthermore, the therapist directly commends the client's efforts and determination, stating, \"I hear you talk and I just have to commend you for all of the steps you have already take... It sounds like you are really determined and I can understand. It sounds like your voice is your livelihood. So I just want to commend you for your determination\" (P13). This affirmation strengthens the client's motivation by linking the change goal to her values (voice as livelihood).\n\nWhile the therapist effectively encourages change talk, there are some instances where opportunities to deepen the exploration of change talk are missed. For example, when the client expresses resistance to cutting out spicy foods (C12), the therapist acknowledges this but doesn't explore the resistance or potential workarounds in depth.  Additionally, the therapist primarily uses reflections and open questions, and does not employ more strategic techniques to *deepen* or *strengthen* change talk, such as using decisional balance when change talk is already strong, or employing evocative questions to explore discrepancies more pointedly.\n\nOverall, the therapist consistently attends to and encourages change talk, aligning with a score of 4, but does not consistently demonstrate the more advanced techniques required for a score of 5, which would involve a \"marked and consistent effort to increase the depth, strength, or momentum of the client's language in favor of change.\""
