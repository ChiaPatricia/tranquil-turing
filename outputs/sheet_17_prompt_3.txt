## Purpose of the MITI

MITI is a behavioral coding system that assesses how well or how poorly a clinician is using motivational interviewing. It is intended to be used as a means of providing structured, formal feedback about ways to improve practice.

## COMPONENTS OF THE MITI

The MITI has two components: the global scores and the behavior counts.

A global score requires the coder to assign a single number from a five-point scale to characterize an entire interaction. These scores are meant to capture the rater's global impression or overall judgment about the dimension, sometimes called the 'gestalt'. Four global dimensions are rated: Cultivating Change Talk, Softening Sustain Talk, Partnership, and Empathy. This means that each MITI review will contain four global scores.

A behavior count requires the coder to tally instances of particular interviewer behaviors. These running tallies occur from the beginning of the segment being reviewed until the end. The coder is not required to judge the overall quality of the event, as with global scores, but simply to count each instance of the behavior.

## DESIGNATING A CHANGE GOAL

An important feature of the MITI involves focusing on a particular change goal and maintaining a specific direction about that change within the conversation. Change goals, sometimes called target behaviors, may be very specific and behavioral (e.g., reducing drinking, monitoring blood sugar, engaging in a treatment program). Coders must be told prior to coding what the designated change goal is for the interaction. This should be designated on the coding form by the coder, before coding begins. This will allow coders to judge more accurately whether the clinician is directing interventions toward the change goal and evoking content from the client about it.

## GLOBAL SCORES

Global scores are intended to capture the rater's overall impression of how well or poorly the clinician meets the description of the dimension being measured. Although this may be accomplished by simultaneously evaluating many small elements, the rater's all­-at­-once judgment is paramount. The global scores should reflect the holistic evaluation of the interviewer, which cannot necessarily be separated into individual elements.

Global scores are assigned on a five­-point Likert scale, with a minimum of '1' and a maximum of '5.' The coder assumes a default score of '3' and moves up or down as indicated. A '3' may also reflect mixed practice. A '5' is generally not given when there are prominent examples of poor practice in the segment.

## Gloal Score - Partnership

This scale is intended to measure the extent to which the clinician conveys an understanding that expertise and wisdom about change reside mostly within the client. Clinicians high on this scale behave as if the interview is occurring between two equal partners, both of whom have knowledge that might be useful in solving the change under consideration. Clinicians low on the scale assume the expert role for a majority of the interaction and have a high degree of influence in the nature of the interaction.

### Score of 1

1 - Clinician actively assumes the expert role for the majority of the interaction with the client. Collaboration or partnership is absent.

Examples:
- Explicitly takes the expert role by defining the problem, prescribing the goals, or laying out the plan of action
- Clinician actively forces a particular agenda for the majority of the interaction with the client
- Denies or minimizes client ideas
- Dominates conversation
- Argues when client offers alternative approach
- Often exhibits the righting reflex

### Score of 2

2 - Clinician superficially responds to opportunities to collaborate.

Examples:
- Clinician rarely surrenders the expert role
- Minimal or superficial querying of client input
- Often sacrifices opportunities for mutual problem solving in favor of supplying knowledge or expertise
- Minimal or superficial responses to client's potential agenda items, knowledge, idea, and/or concerns

### Score of 3

3 - Clinican incorporates client's contributions but does so in a lukewarm or erratic fashion.

Examples:
- May take advantage of opportunities to collaborate, but does not structure interaction to solicit this
- Misses some opportunities to collaborate when initiated by the client
- The righting reflex is largely absent
- Sacrifices some opportunities for mutual problem solving in favor of supplying knowledge or advice
- Seems to be in a stand-­off with the client; not wrestling and not dancing

### Score of 4

4 - Clinician fosters collaboration and power sharing so that client's contributions impact the session in ways that they otherwise would not.

Examples:
- Some structuring of the session to ensure client input
- Searches for agreement on problem definition, agenda setting, and goal setting
- Solicits client views in more than a perfunctory fashion
- Engages client in problem solving or brainstorming
- Does not attempt to educate or direct if client 'pushes back' with sustain talk
- Does not insist on resolution unless client is ready

### Score of 5

5 - Clinician actively fosters and encourages power sharing in the interaction in such a way that client's contributions substantially influence the nature of the session.

Examples:
- Genuinely negotiates the agenda and goals for the session
- Indicates curiosity about client ideas through querying and listening
- Facilitates client evaluation of options and planning
- Explicitly identifies client as the expert and decision maker
- Tempers advice giving and expertise depending on client input
- Clinician favors discussion of client's strengths and resources rather than probing for deficits

     C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Well, yeah, the doctor thought it would be a good idea – I’m not, I don’t know but
     P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Yeah your doctor spoke with me and I’m wondering if it would be ok with you if I share some of the information that he talked about
     C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Well yeah, I guess, I mean he talked to me too but I guess, yeah, what did he tell you?
     P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sure, well why don’t we make sure we’re on the same page. So he indicated to me that he’s a little bit concerned about how much you’re drinking and thought it might be helpful if you and I just talk a little bit and see what’s been going on. Does that work for you?
     C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Well yeah, I mean you know it’s not, it’s not really, I don’t believe it’s the drinking that’s really the problem, it’s my, you know, I’m having some stomach problems.
     P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Right right. So you don’t see the drinking as the cause of all this. You think, you know, you’re having this stomach issue and the drinking’s not really related.
     C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Yeah, I actually think that it’s probably more related to both the stress that I have going on and what I’ve been eating. And you know I think there must be something that I’m eating... I know other people who had that kind of problem and you know rather than the drinking, cause I just don’t drink that much
     P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Right, right, well I’m not a medical doctor, you know, I don’t know all the ins and outs but if it’s ok with can I talk to you a little bit about what he shared specifically in terms of how much you were drinking and then some norms, people in terms of their drinking – how much they drink- would that be okay if we talk about that for a moment?
     C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Okay
     P                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Okay, so your doctor indicated to me that he’s pretty worried actually about your drinking and what he said to me was that it looks like you might be drinking about six drinks a day, and that, you know, some of the assessments you filled out - it looks like about six drinks a day. Now, do you remember talking to him about this or that’s what you *( inaudible) in terms of your drinking
     C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Well, you know, I mean, I’m drink – you know, I’m not, I don’t know, he asked me about how much you know and I, you know, pretty much said I kinda have a, you know, usually have a bottle of wine every day. But I, you know, I don’t, he didn’t ask me, he didn’t say anything about six I mean I just, you know, it’s just like one bottle

There’s something called the...these guidelines that NIAAA, which is just organization has, in terms in how much people should drink. I don’t know if you’ve heard of these or if you are familiar with them at all.

Does that, how does that fit with your current drinking right now?

     P                                                                                                                           Right so your numbers don’t necessarily match up with his. Well, I mean I can tell you that regardless of the exact numbers you know I think his concern is that your drinking is quite a bit more than what is recommended and you know six drinks per day or four drinks per day, it doesn’t really matter how much, it puts, generally puts people at risk for a number of health problems, sometimes legal problems, social problems and so I think that’s why he wanted me to talk with you a bit.

I do it at home and, you know, I don’t see any, you know, I’m not having problems with my family or anything other than my, you know, I’m having stress related to my teenagers. I’ve got one that’s really acting up and it’s causing me a lot of stress so you know I know I’m drinking more than I used to drink but you know or did a coupla years ago but it’s just because there’s so much stress

I guess if it’s causing, if it has to do with my, you know, stomach – I am really worried about what’s going on with my stomach cause it’s pretty painful

I mean I do know that that’s more than is, you know, that’s not good for me

I mean I should be able to just, I should be able to reduce that I guess but it’s hard for me to imagine not being able to, to do it, you know I mean it’s just, otherwise the anxiety’s just gonna bowl me over, you know

Drinking is...so it’s something that you do in a lot of ways to cope with some of the stress you’ve got going on. And it sounds like you’re working really hard and you have a lot going on with your kids and that you’re trying to be the best mom that you can be to them and drinking has made a lot of that easier for you

Right. No, that makes a lot of sense. You have a lot going on and that’s been a way for you to cope and I can see that. So on the one hand, you know, drinking is – you’re worried about what it’s doing to your stomach and you’re worried about the possible health consequences of it. On the other hand it’s a big part of your life and helping you get through some difficult times.

Well, would it be all right if I give you, you know, some ideas about how to possibly cut back on your drinking?

     P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              So it sounds like you’re drinking anywhere from 4 to 6 drinks a night and really we don’t want people drinking more than a glass of wine , so really you shouldn’t be drinking more than a glass of wine a day or more than 7 drinks a week. So, you know, there’s lots of ways people can cut back, but what does that, how does that sound to you?

So making some changes seems like it would work for you but you’re not willing to cut back all the way to one

I guess, you know, it should help my stomach, though, if I cut back even a little bit, shouldn’t it, if it really is doing, if it’s causing some of the problem?
     P   Yeah, I mean cutting back is always better, right? And you know I think your doctor was pretty firm that he would really like you to cut back possibly, what he said to me is “I’ll take a third” cause he’s worried your continued drinking affecting your stomach and that what he thought was going on was that it was kind of tearing up the lining of your stomach so that any alcohol, caffeine, coffee that kind of thing, that could all potentially cause you problems. But it sounds like that doesn’t, like it’s not going to work. That you’re not willing to cut back to one or you know, quit drinking altogether

Yeah, coffee too? Man he didn’t talk to me about that

And yeah, I think he was worried about taking away it all for you at once, but you know...

You know sometimes I have patients who find other things or other ways to relax and they start doing those at about the time they started drinking or beforehand and that helps them, you know, have something else to occupy their time when they would typically start drinking. So that might be something for you to consider.

I run them around I do all the things I’m supposed to do to take care of them, so, you know, I mean I guess if I really got sick then I wouldn’t be able to do it, but I’ve been able to work through, you know how we women we have to work through everything. You don’t get to be sick
     P No (*inaudible) and you’re doing a great job of it and it’s sounds like you have an important role in your family. It also sounds like you have a lot going on and that, you know, there might be other ways to deal with some of the stress other than relying on the drinking. But this again, it has to be your choice. You know, I can tell you that, you know, your doctor does think that some of these stomach problems may be linked back to the drinking, but you know what I’m not a medical provider and you know, I think ultimately you’re the one that gets to make the decision about how you proceed with things.

 </transcript> 

Based on the transcript provided, I would give the therapist a global score of **3** for Partnership.

Here's my feedback, breaking down why and suggesting areas for improvement:

**Score Justification:**

A score of 3 indicates "Clinician incorporates client's contributions but does so in a lukewarm or erratic fashion."  This feels like a fair assessment of this interaction.  Here's why:

* **Initial Attempts at Partnership (Positive):**
    * The therapist starts by checking in with the client and asking permission to share information from the doctor ("...would it be ok with you if I share some of the information that he talked about"). This is a respectful and collaborative opening.
    * The therapist also checks if the summary of the doctor's concerns "works for you" ("Does that work for you?"). This invites the client's perspective early on.
    * The therapist reflects back the client's initial pushback about drinking not being the primary problem ("So you don’t see the drinking as the cause of all this."). This shows some listening and acknowledgement of the client's viewpoint.
    * When the client suggests a reduction to "half a bottle, like maybe two drinks," the therapist acknowledges this and summarizes it ("Right. So making some changes seems like it would work for you but you’re not willing to cut back all the way to one"). This shows some responsiveness to the client's ideas.

* **Missed Opportunities and Expert Role (Areas for Improvement):**
    * **Righting Reflex:** The therapist falls into the "righting reflex" multiple times, particularly when presenting information about drinking guidelines and the doctor's concerns.  For example:
        * "really we don’t want people drinking more than a glass of wine , so really you shouldn’t be drinking more than a glass of wine a day or more than 7 drinks a week." This is directive and prescriptive, rather than exploratory.
        * "Yeah, I mean cutting back is always better, right? And you know I think your doctor was pretty firm that he would really like you to cut back..." This reinforces the expert's (doctor's) opinion and pushes for a specific direction.
    * **Limited Exploration of Client's Agenda:** While the client clearly states that stomach problems and stress are her primary concerns, the therapist quickly steers the conversation back to drinking and the doctor's agenda.  There isn't deep exploration of the client's perspectives on stress management, coping mechanisms, or the stomach issues themselves.
    * **Information Giving as Primary Strategy:**  The therapist relies heavily on providing information (doctor's concerns, drinking guidelines) rather than eliciting the client's own understanding, motivations, and ideas for change. This positions the therapist as the expert with knowledge to impart, rather than a partner exploring change with the client.
    * **Superficial Negotiation:** While the therapist asks "What seems like a reasonable number for you?", this feels somewhat perfunctory.  The conversation quickly reverts back to the doctor's recommendations and the "better to cut back" message, rather than genuinely exploring the client's rationale for her suggested reduction or further negotiating a mutually agreeable plan.
    * **Focus on Deficits:** The conversation is largely problem-focused (drinking as a problem, potential health risks) rather than strength-based.  While there's a brief acknowledgement of the client's role as a mother, it's quickly followed by a concern about self-care deficits, reinforcing a problem-oriented approach.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

To increase the Partnership score, the therapist could focus on the following:

1. **Reduce the Righting Reflex:** Resist the urge to correct, persuade, or give unsolicited advice, especially when the client expresses sustain talk or differing perspectives. Instead, explore the client's perspective with curiosity.
2. **Deepen Exploration of Client's Agenda:**  When the client brings up stomach problems and stress, genuinely explore these areas. Ask open-ended questions to understand her experience, concerns, and ideas related to these issues.  For example:
    * "Tell me more about what's been going on with your stomach."
    * "What kind of stress are you experiencing right now?"
    * "How have you been coping with stress in the past?"
3. **Elicit Client's Own Understanding and Ideas:** Instead of primarily providing information, ask questions to elicit the client's own understanding of the situation, her concerns, and her ideas for potential changes. For example:
    * "What are your thoughts about the connection between drinking and your stomach problems?"
    * "What, if anything, have you considered doing about your drinking?"
    * "What would be some small steps you might be willing to take?"
4. **Emphasize Client Autonomy and Choice:**  While the therapist mentions "it has to be your choice," this could be strengthened throughout the conversation.  Explicitly acknowledge that the decision about change is entirely up to the client.
5. **Shift to a Strength-Based Approach:**  Actively look for and reflect the client's strengths, values, and resources.  Connect potential change to what is important to her (e.g., being a good mother, managing stress).  For example, building on the therapist's statement: "It sounds like you really value being a good mother...", the therapist could have followed up with: "How does your current drinking fit with your value of being a good mother, in your opinion?"

By focusing on these areas, the therapist can move towards a more collaborative and partnership-oriented approach, which is central to Motivational Interviewing.  This will likely lead to a higher Partnership score in future interactions.
