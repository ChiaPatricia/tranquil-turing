Empathy Global Score: 4

## Feedback on Empathy

This therapist demonstrates a good level of empathy, scoring a **4** on the MITI Global Rating Scale for Empathy.  Here's a breakdown of why and some suggestions for further growth:

**Strengths (Aligned with Score of 4):**

* **Active and Repeated Efforts to Understand:** The therapist consistently makes an effort to understand the client's perspective throughout the conversation.  They ask open-ended questions like "How are you feeling at the moment and how are you feeling about your diabetes?" and "In what way? How would this improve your life? How do you see that?" which invite the client to share their viewpoint.
* **Accurate Reflections of Explicit Content:** The therapist effectively uses reflections to mirror back what the client is saying. Examples include:
    * Client: "So you know what you should be doing, but it’s not so easy to do it."
    * Therapist: "So you know what you should be doing, but it’s not so easy to do it."
    * Client: "It’s the exercise I’m really stumbling over badly."
    * Therapist: "Right. So the thought of taking exercise is just not a pleasant one for you."
    * Client: "It is. It really is frustrating, and I wish I would just get beyond it and go get the exercise done."
    * Therapist: "And so that must be quite frustrating for you, knowing . ."
* **Conveys Interest in Client's Perspective:** The therapist uses verbal and non-verbal cues (like "Right," "Yeah," and noting the client's sigh) to show they are engaged and listening attentively to the client's experience.
* **Effectively Communicates Understanding:**  The therapist's reflections and summaries demonstrate that they are grasping the client's main points and concerns, such as the barrier to exercise and the frustrating self-talk.  For example, "So you can see all these good reasons why it would be a good idea, but you hit a barrier, and what you’d really like to do is to try and break through that barrier somehow."

**Areas for Potential Growth (Moving Towards a Score of 5):**

* **Deeper Understanding Beyond Explicit Content:** While the therapist reflects what the client *says*, there are opportunities to explore what the client *means and has not said*.  To move towards a score of 5, the therapist could incorporate more complex reflections that anticipate unspoken feelings or underlying meanings.
    * **Example:** When the client sighs after the therapist suggests finding enjoyable exercise, instead of just noting the sigh ("although I see you sighing when I raise it"), the therapist could explore the feeling behind the sigh with a more complex reflection like: "That sigh suggests that even the idea of finding enjoyable exercise feels a bit daunting or maybe even hopeless right now?" This goes beyond the explicit statement and explores potential underlying feelings of discouragement.
* **"Putting Self in Client's Shoes" More Explicitly:** While the therapist demonstrates understanding, making more explicit statements that convey an attempt to "put self in client's shoes" could further enhance empathy.
    * **Example:** After the client describes the internal struggle with excuses, the therapist could say something like: "It sounds incredibly tiring to be constantly battling with yourself like that, always finding reasons *not* to exercise even when you know you want to. It must feel like you're stuck in a real bind." This type of reflection more explicitly conveys an attempt to understand the emotional burden of the client's experience.
* **Encouraging Elaboration Beyond the Story:** The therapist does encourage elaboration, but often to clarify the story or problem. To reach a score of 5, the therapist could more consistently encourage elaboration that delves deeper into the client's feelings, values, and motivations related to the change goal.
    * **Example:** After the client says, "I don’t like it!" about exercise, the therapist could ask: "Tell me more about what it is about exercise that you don't like.  Is it the physical feeling, the time commitment, something else entirely?" This encourages the client to explore the *why* behind their dislike, potentially uncovering deeper motivations or barriers.

**Summary:**

This therapist is demonstrating solid empathic skills and is effectively building rapport and understanding with the client. By focusing on moving beyond explicit content and incorporating more complex and anticipatory reflections, as well as explicitly conveying an attempt to understand the client's experience from their perspective, the therapist can further strengthen their empathic approach and move towards a score of 5 in future interactions.
