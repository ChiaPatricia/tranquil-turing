## Global Score for Cultivating Change Talk: 4

**Feedback:**

This therapist demonstrates good skills in Cultivating Change Talk, earning a global score of **4**.  Here's a breakdown of why and some areas for potential growth:

**Strengths (Aligned with Score of 4):**

* **Consistent Attention to Change Talk:** The therapist consistently picks up on and responds to the client's change talk throughout the session.  Examples include reflecting "You feel like you’ve already been making efforts to change the way you’re disciplining your child," and "And you came out OK from the parenting you got from your Dad, and you were thinking that it would turn out OK for Mikie, but as you’re looking at the way things are going, you’re saying, “You know what, I think I need more." These reflections acknowledge and validate the client's movement towards change.
* **Efforts to Encourage Change Talk:** The therapist uses open-ended questions to explore the client's desire for change, such as "Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Like how would you like to change the way you are with your child?" and "Well, what thoughts have you had about different ways that you might discipline your child...?" These questions invite the client to elaborate on their change goals and potential solutions.
* **Exploration of Values and Discrepancy:** The therapist effectively explores the client's values ("respect," "being a good father," "not wanting his son to be afraid") and highlights the discrepancy between his current parenting methods and his desired outcomes.  For example, "Huh. So even though you’re trying to have a child that’s respectful and strong, and not weak, what’s happening is the exact reverse..." This helps to amplify the client's motivation for change by pointing out the misalignment with his values.
* **Affirmation of Change Talk and Self-Efficacy:** The therapist offers affirmations that reinforce the client's commitment to change, such as "I think you can do it too, and I think that you really have taken a step towards becoming a better parent, and you’ve just made up your mind that this is something you’re going to do. I can see it, right." This builds the client's confidence in their ability to change.

**Areas for Potential Growth (Moving towards a Score of 5):**

* **Deeper Exploration of Change Talk:** While the therapist responds to change talk, some reflections could be crafted to encourage *deeper* exploration. For instance, when the client says "I’d like to be more patient," the therapist responds with "I see."  While appropriate, a slightly more evocative reflection like, "So, patience feels like a key ingredient in the kind of father you want to be. What does being more patient look like in practice with Mikie?" could further explore the meaning and implications of this change goal.
* **Strategic Elicitation of Change Talk:**  While open questions are used, the therapist could be even more strategic in *eliciting* specific types of change talk. For example, after the client expresses dissatisfaction with his current approach, the therapist could have asked a question specifically designed to elicit *desire* change talk, such as "If things were to change for the better regarding your parenting, what would be the best things about that for you and Mikie?" or *ability* change talk, such as "Thinking about being more patient, what strengths do you already have that you could draw upon in those challenging moments?"
* **Building Momentum and Shaping Change Talk:**  At times, the conversation veers slightly into sustain talk, particularly around the client's concerns about the group format and his image. While acknowledging these concerns is important for partnership, the therapist could be more proactive in gently guiding the conversation back to change talk and building momentum around the client's desire to change his disciplinary approach.  For example, after reflecting the client's concerns about the group, the therapist could have transitioned back to change talk by saying something like, "It sounds like finding the right support is important, and even with some reservations about the group format, your desire to find better ways to connect with Mikie and not rely on physical discipline is still really strong."

**In summary, this therapist demonstrates solid MI skills in Cultivating Change Talk and is operating at a level 4. By focusing on deepening explorations of change talk, strategically eliciting specific types of change talk, and consistently building momentum, the therapist could further refine their skills and move towards a score of 5.**
