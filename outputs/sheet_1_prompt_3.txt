## Feedback on Partnership in the Provided Transcript

Based on the transcript provided and the MITI guidelines, I would score the therapist's **Partnership** globally as a **4**.

Here's my reasoning, drawing from the MITI Partnership score descriptions and specific examples from the transcript:

**Justification for a Score of 4:**

A score of 4 indicates that the "Clinician fosters collaboration and power sharing so that client's contributions impact the session in ways that they otherwise would not."  This accurately describes the interaction in the transcript.

**Strengths Demonstrated by the Therapist (Examples supporting a score of 4):**

* **Structuring for Client Input:** The therapist begins with an open-ended question, "Can you tell me a little bit about that?" which immediately invites the client to take the lead and share their perspective. This sets a collaborative tone from the outset.
* **Soliciting Client Views in More Than a Perfunctory Fashion:** Throughout the session, the therapist consistently uses open-ended questions to delve deeper into the client's thoughts and feelings about smoking. Examples include:
    * "And why is that, do you think?"
    * "Yeah, I was just going to ask you about that..."
    * "And what do you think has kept you from trying..."
    * "I wonder what things you’ve thought of to make yourself successful..."
    * "And what makes you choose a five and not, say, a two?" (Used for both importance and confidence rulers)
    These questions are not just surface-level; they encourage the client to explore their motivations, barriers, and readiness for change in detail.
* **Engaging Client in Problem Solving/Brainstorming (Implicitly):** While not explicit brainstorming, the therapist guides the client to explore the *problem* of smoking and potential *solutions* (like seeking information about quitting). By reflecting and asking clarifying questions, the therapist helps the client to articulate their own understanding of the situation and potential paths forward. For example, the therapist's reflections on the client's ambivalence and the need for more information implicitly guide the client towards considering solutions.
* **Does Not Attempt to Educate or Direct if Client 'Pushes Back' with Sustain Talk:**  The client expresses sustain talk throughout the conversation ("I like to smoke," "Cigarettes are now a part of your character," "Cannot even imagine being without a cigarette"). The therapist does not argue against this sustain talk or try to right the client. Instead, they accept and explore it, using reflections like "And you can’t even imagine yourself without a cigarette" and "Mmm. When you think about your life without cigarettes, it’s just a big blank." This demonstrates respect for the client's perspective and avoids pushing for change prematurely.
* **Does Not Insist on Resolution Unless Client is Ready:** The therapist uses importance and confidence rulers towards the end of the session.  When the client rates both at a "5," the therapist accepts this rating without pushing for a higher score or immediate action. This respects the client's readiness level and avoids forcing a resolution.

**Areas for Potential Growth (Moving towards a score of 5):**

While the therapist demonstrates good partnership skills, there are subtle nuances that could be enhanced to potentially reach a score of 5:

* **Genuinely Negotiates the Agenda and Goals for the Session:** While the initial question is open, there isn't explicit negotiation of the agenda beyond talking about smoking.  A score of 5 might involve more explicit collaboration on what aspects of smoking to discuss or what the client hopes to achieve in the session. For example, the therapist could have asked something like, "What would be most helpful for us to talk about regarding your smoking today?"
* **Explicitly Identifies Client as the Expert and Decision Maker:** While implicit in the therapist's approach, explicitly stating something like, "You are the expert on your own experience with smoking, and ultimately, any decision about change is yours to make," could further strengthen the partnership.
* **Clinician favors discussion of client's strengths and resources rather than probing for deficits:**  The conversation is primarily focused on the challenges and burdens of smoking, and the client's ambivalence. While this is important, a move towards a 5 could involve more explicit exploration of the client's strengths, past successes in other areas, or resources they could draw upon if they decided to quit.

**In summary, the therapist in this transcript demonstrates a strong commitment to partnership, effectively fostering collaboration and respecting the client's autonomy.  A global score of 4 for Partnership is well-deserved and reflects skillful application of Motivational Interviewing principles in this area.**  Focusing on more explicit agenda negotiation and highlighting client strengths could be areas for further refinement to move towards an even stronger demonstration of Partnership.
