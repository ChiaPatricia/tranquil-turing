Based on the transcript provided and the MITI Global Score descriptions for Empathy, I would assign a global score of **1** for Empathy.

**Reasoning:**

The therapist in this transcript demonstrates very little to no attention to the client's perspective.  Here's a breakdown based on the MITI score descriptions:

* **Score of 1: Clinician gives little or no attention to the client's perspective.**  This description aligns strongly with the therapist's behavior in the transcript.

**Examples from the transcript supporting a score of 1:**

* **Dismissive of Client's Perspective:** When the client describes the DWI as a "fluke" and "bad luck," the therapist immediately dismisses this perspective with "So Randy you know at this treatment center we don’t treat bad luck. That’s not what we do here." This completely shuts down the client's framing of the situation without any attempt to understand it.
* **Focus on Therapist's Agenda:** The therapist repeatedly emphasizes "I don’t work for the judge. I work for you," but this is framed in a confrontational way rather than an empathetic way. It prioritizes the therapist's agenda and definition of "working for the client" over understanding the client's needs and perspective.
* **Sarcasm and Confrontation:**  The therapist uses sarcasm ("If the shoe fits, fine." and "So 50 beers a week sounds like a reasonable amount of alcohol for you to be drinking.") and confrontational statements ("I think that at an AA meeting they’re not going to put up with a lot of denial and minimization and the kind of thing I’ve been hearing form you here.") which are the opposite of empathy.
* **Lack of Reflection and Understanding:** The therapist primarily focuses on information-seeking questions related to drinking quantity and consequences, and directly challenges the client's statements without reflecting back any understanding of the client's feelings or viewpoint.  There are minimal attempts at reflection, and none that could be considered complex or insightful.
* **Ignoring Underlying Concerns:** While the client expresses some potential concern about liver damage ("Well I don’t know I mean is that enough to damage your liver?"), the therapist immediately jumps to factual information about health risks rather than exploring the client's underlying ambivalence or worries.

**In summary,** the therapist in this transcript is primarily directive, confrontational, and focused on pushing the client towards a specific conclusion (acknowledging a problem and attending AA). There is a distinct lack of curiosity about the client's internal experience, worldview, or feelings. The therapist does not attempt to "try on" what the client feels or thinks, and in fact, often seems to be arguing against the client's perspective.  Therefore, a global score of **1** for Empathy is the most accurate and appropriate rating based on the MITI guidelines.
