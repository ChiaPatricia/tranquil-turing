## Feedback on Partnership in Motivational Interviewing

Based on the transcript you provided and the MITI guidelines, here is feedback on the therapist's Partnership global score.

**Global Score for Partnership: 4**

**Justification:**

The therapist demonstrates a good level of Partnership, aligning with a score of 4. Here's why:

* **Fostering Collaboration and Power Sharing:** The therapist actively seeks to understand the client's perspective and incorporates it into the conversation.  The session is not dominated by the therapist's agenda, but rather unfolds as an exploration of the client's experience and views.
* **Soliciting Client Views:** The therapist consistently asks open-ended questions to understand the client's thoughts and feelings. Examples include:
    * "Yeah, because it sounds like something of a mystery to you, almost, why you’re down here, and quite what went wrong there with the surgery." -  Reflecting and seeking clarification of the client's confusion.
    * "And the pain that you’re going through with your knee and the confusion about quite what went wrong, it’s like you don’t really need another problem do deal with right now, eh." - Validating the client's current experience and linking it to the perceived irrelevance of smoking cessation.
    * "And would you mind if I asked you how you actually felt about your smoking?" - Directly inviting the client's perspective on their smoking.
    * "And what other circumstances do you enjoy smoking in?" - Further exploring the client's experience and values related to smoking.
    * "And so how did you feel about coming down here today to talk about all of this?" - Checking in with the client's emotional state and acknowledging their potential reluctance.
* **Acknowledging and Validating Client's Perspective:** The therapist consistently validates the client's feelings and perspective, even when it expresses resistance or skepticism. Examples include:
    * "I can see it couldn’t have been easy for you to get up here today." - Acknowledging the client's physical discomfort.
    * "Yeah, because it sounds like something of a mystery to you, almost, why you’re down here..." - Validating the client's confusion and suspicion.
    * "Yeah. And the pain that you’re going through with your knee and the confusion about quite what went wrong, it’s like you don’t really need another problem do deal with right now, eh." -  Validating the client's feeling of being overwhelmed and the perceived irrelevance of smoking cessation.
    * "A little chagrined, a little chagrined, I’ll be honest. Like I said before, no offence to you." "Sure" -  Accepting and normalizing the client's negative feelings about being there.
* **Avoiding the Righting Reflex:**  When the client expresses resistance ("I just don’t see how it applies to me"), the therapist does not argue or try to convince the client of the importance of smoking cessation. Instead, the therapist reflects and validates the client's perspective.
* **Focus on Understanding Client's Motivation (or lack thereof):** The therapist shifts the focus from directly addressing smoking cessation to understanding the client's current experience, values, and motivations related to smoking. This is a collaborative approach, respecting the client's autonomy.

**Areas for Potential Growth (Moving towards a Score of 5):**

While the therapist demonstrates good Partnership, there are subtle opportunities to further enhance it and move towards a score of 5:

* **Explicitly Negotiating the Agenda:** While the therapist responds to the client's agenda (knee pain and skepticism), there isn't explicit negotiation of the session's agenda at the beginning.  A more explicit statement like, "You mentioned you're here because Dr. Ross suggested it, and you're feeling unsure about how this relates to your knee.  How would you like to use our time today?  Perhaps we could talk more about your knee and how smoking might be related, or is there something else that would be most helpful for you to discuss?" could further empower the client and make the partnership more explicit.
* **Highlighting Client Strengths and Resources:** While the therapist explores the client's perspective, there isn't a strong emphasis on explicitly identifying and discussing the client's strengths and resources.  In later parts of the conversation (not shown in this excerpt),  exploring the client's strengths in managing stress or social connections, even within the context of smoking, could further enhance the partnership and move towards a score of 5.
* **More Explicitly Identifying the Client as the Expert:**  While implied, the therapist could more explicitly state that the client is the expert on their own life and experience.  Phrases like, "You're the expert on your own experience with smoking, and I'm here to understand it better from your perspective" could reinforce the partnership.

**Summary:**

Overall, the therapist demonstrates a solid understanding of Partnership in Motivational Interviewing, reflected in a global score of 4. The therapist effectively listens, validates, and seeks to understand the client's perspective. By incorporating more explicit agenda negotiation and further emphasizing client strengths and expertise, the therapist could further refine their skills and move towards an even stronger demonstration of Partnership (score of 5).
