## Feedback on Partnership in Motivational Interviewing

Based on the transcript provided and the MITI guidelines, here is a global score and feedback on the **Partnership** dimension:

**Global Score for Partnership: 2**

**Justification:**

A score of **2** for Partnership indicates that the clinician **superficially responds to opportunities to collaborate** and **rarely surrenders the expert role.**  This aligns with the observed interaction in the transcript. Let's break down why this score is appropriate and provide specific examples from the transcript:

* **Expert Role Predominates:** The provider primarily takes on the expert role throughout the conversation.  From the beginning, the provider states, "Dr. Jones asked me to come and talk with you about your new diagnosis of silent reflux," immediately positioning themselves as the knowledgeable figure delivering information.  This expert stance continues as the provider explains "why they call it 'silent',"  asserts "You do really need to take some action now to get it under control," and proceeds to give a series of recommendations.

    * **Example:** "Well that’s why they call it “silent”. You probably have had it for quite some time and didn’t even know it. It can take a long time for the symptoms like yours to show up. **You do really need to take some action now to get it under control.**" (Provider is educating and directing).

* **Minimal Exploration of Client's Expertise:**  The transcript shows limited attempts to genuinely explore the client's own understanding, ideas, or resources regarding managing her reflux or making lifestyle changes. While the provider asks questions, they often serve to confirm the provider's agenda or advice rather than to elicit the client's perspective as equally valuable.

    * **Example:** "When do you usually stop eating in the evening?" This question is asked *after* the provider has already given advice about not eating before bed. It feels more like information gathering to support the pre-determined advice rather than genuinely exploring the client's existing routines and potential solutions.

* **Missed Opportunities for Collaboration:** When the client offers her own insights or potential challenges, the provider often acknowledges them briefly but quickly reverts back to the expert role and providing more information or advice.

    * **Example:** Client: "Well at least some of the time. You know when you have company or something it is a lot harder."
    * Provider: "Right. Right. And speaking of company, alcohol and caffeine..."  Instead of exploring the client's challenges with social situations and eating habits, the provider immediately pivots to more advice about irritants. This misses an opportunity to collaborate on problem-solving around real-life barriers.

* **Superficial Responses to Client Input:**  When the client mentions her past weight loss experience and its potential positive impact on her cough, the provider's response is lighthearted ("Well we’ll send you to Hawaii every other month!") and then quickly moves back to the agenda: "Well I’m glad you know how to lose weight because that will be helpful. So what are your plans for taking care of this?"  This response, while attempting to be positive, doesn't deeply engage with the client's experience or explore her own ideas about weight management in a collaborative way.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

To increase the Partnership score in future interactions, the provider could focus on the following:

* **Elicit-Provide-Elicit (EPE):** Before providing information or advice, explicitly ask for the client's perspective and understanding. After providing information, check back with the client to see how it resonates with them.
* **Explore Client's Knowledge and Resources:**  Actively inquire about what the client already knows about managing reflux, what strategies she has considered, and what resources she has available.
* **Focus on Client's Strengths and Past Successes:**  Build upon the client's mention of past weight loss success. Explore what worked for her then, what she learned, and how she might leverage those strengths again.
* **Negotiate the Agenda:**  While the initial topic is set by the referral, the provider could still negotiate the focus of the session. For example, "Dr. Jones asked me to talk with you about managing reflux.  What would be most helpful for us to discuss today regarding that?"
* **Reduce Righting Reflex:** Resist the urge to immediately correct or direct the client. Instead, when the client expresses doubts or challenges, explore those with curiosity and open-ended questions.
* **Emphasize Client Autonomy:**  Explicitly acknowledge that the decisions about managing her health are ultimately the client's. Use language that reflects shared decision-making rather than prescribing actions.

By shifting from a primarily expert-driven approach to a more collaborative and client-centered style, the provider can significantly enhance the Partnership dimension of Motivational Interviewing and potentially improve client engagement and outcomes.
