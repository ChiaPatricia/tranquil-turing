## Feedback on Partnership Global Score

Based on the transcript you provided, here is a global score for **Partnership** and some feedback:

**Global Score for Partnership: 4**

**Rationale:**

The therapist demonstrates a good level of partnership throughout this brief interaction, aligning with a score of 4. Here's a breakdown based on the MITI descriptions:

**Strengths aligning with a Score of 4:**

* **Structuring for Client Input:** The therapist explicitly asks the client "I mean, you’re here now, and we’ve got a few minutes, and I’m just wondering what would make the most sense to you as to how we spend our time." This is a clear invitation for the client to guide the session and demonstrates a collaborative approach from the outset.
* **Searching for Agreement:** The therapist seeks to understand the client's perspective and agenda.  They acknowledge the client's initial uncertainty about being there and explore the client's understanding of the referral.
* **Soliciting Client Views:** The therapist consistently asks open-ended questions to understand the client's perspective on their smoking.  Examples include: "how you feel about your smoking," "What do you notice about the effect of smoking on your sport?", "Is there anything else about it that you’re concerned about that you haven’t mentioned?", "What is it you’d most like to know about stop smoking aids?". These questions genuinely invite the client's thoughts and feelings.
* **Engaging in Problem Solving/Brainstorming (Implicitly):** While not explicit brainstorming, the therapist facilitates the client's exploration of their own ambivalence and potential solutions (like stop smoking aids) based on the client's own concerns (side effects, cost).
* **Avoiding Direction with Sustain Talk:** When the client expresses enjoyment of smoking and rationalizations ("you can get hit by a bus"), the therapist doesn't argue or right, but rather reflects and explores further.
* **Not Insisting on Resolution:** The therapist ends the session by summarizing the client's current stance ("You might even give it a try"), respecting the client's autonomy and not pushing for a commitment to change.

**Areas for Potential Growth (Moving towards a Score of 5):**

* **Explicitly Negotiating Agenda and Goals:** While the therapist asks about how to spend the time, they could be even more explicit in negotiating the agenda. For example, after the client expresses uncertainty about being there, the therapist could have said something like, "It sounds like you're unsure about why Dr. Ross referred you here and what we should talk about today.  How about we spend a few minutes figuring out what would be most helpful for you in our time together?" This would be a more direct negotiation of the agenda.
* **Explicitly Identifying Client as Expert:**  While the therapist implicitly treats the client as the expert on their own experience, they could make this more explicit. For instance, when discussing stop smoking aids, the therapist could have said something like, "You know yourself best, and you're the expert on what would work for you. What are your initial thoughts or questions about these aids?"
* **Focus on Strengths and Resources (Could be more pronounced):**  While the therapist focuses on understanding the client's perspective, there could be a slightly stronger emphasis on explicitly eliciting and highlighting the client's strengths and resources.  For example, after the client mentions playing rugby, the therapist could have asked about other strengths or things they are proud of, connecting these to potential change.

**Overall:**

The therapist demonstrates a solid foundation in partnership. They are working collaboratively with the client, respecting their autonomy, and eliciting their perspective.  A score of 4 is commendable and indicates good MI practice in this dimension.  Focusing on even more explicit agenda negotiation and highlighting client strengths could further enhance their partnership skills and move towards a score of 5.
