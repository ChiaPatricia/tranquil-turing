  "Partnership_Global_Score": 2,
  "Partnership_Justification": "The therapist in this transcript demonstrates behaviors consistent with a Partnership global score of 2.  While not a score of 1 (actively assuming expert role), the therapist primarily leads the conversation and directs the agenda, only superficially responding to opportunities for collaboration. \n\n**Examples supporting a score of 2:**\n\n* **Setting the Agenda (Expert-led):** The therapist starts by stating the purpose of the discussion: \"And the purpose of our discussion today is to go through the processes that we need to talk about, check how you feel about them. Also for me to give you every encouragement to take advantage of the opportunity that you’ve been given here.\" This clearly sets the therapist's agenda and expert role from the outset, rather than negotiating an agenda with the client.\n\n* **Information Gathering as Expert:** The therapist asks a series of questions to confirm their understanding of the situation: \"My understanding was that there was an incident at home which was picked up by the school, is that right?\", \"Yeah, it was picked up by the school. Then the teacher called the social worker, and you had a discussion with the social worker.\", \"And you spoke to the social worker who felt that because you were involved in physical contact with your child, that that was something that might make you suitable for this program that I run here.\", \"Have I got that right?\", \"do you understand how long they go on for and that sort of thing?\", \"And are you OK about attending?\" These questions are primarily for information gathering from the therapist's perspective and to lead towards the program, not to deeply explore the client's understanding or perspective.\n\n* **Superficial Response to Client Input:** When the client expresses resistance (\"Yeah. I don’t want to go.\", \"Because I think I do . . I think I’m a good Dad already. I don’t have a problem with the way I’ve been doing things.\"), the therapist's response, while acknowledging the client's statement, quickly pivots back to the therapist's agenda and challenges the client's view: \"You don’t want to go. Tell me why you don’t want to go.\", followed immediately by \"And then how do you see the link between being a good Dad and hitting your child like that? I don’t mean to be rude, but if you don’t want to come to the classes, how does that puzzle fit together for you. Can you see what I’m saying?\" This response, while asking 'why', quickly moves to a 'righting reflex' approach, trying to point out the discrepancy from the therapist's expert perspective.\n\n* **Minimal Surrender of Expert Role:**  The therapist consistently frames the situation and the solution (parenting classes) from an expert standpoint.  Statements like \"Well, I, you know, I must say to you that the purpose of the parenting classes is to help you learn different ways of going about it, so I’m just hoping that you will take advantage of that opportunity...\" reinforce the expert role and the therapist's direction.\n\n* **Sacrificing Mutual Problem Solving:**  Instead of engaging in mutual problem-solving about the client's concerns or resistance, the therapist focuses on persuading the client to attend the classes, supplying knowledge and expertise about the program's purpose.\n\n**Why not a score of 3?** While the therapist does acknowledge the client's statements and doesn't completely ignore them, the incorporation of client contributions is more superficial than lukewarm or erratic. The interaction is consistently driven by the therapist's agenda and expert perspective, with limited genuine attempts to structure the interaction to solicit and value client expertise or to negotiate the direction of the conversation. The therapist is not in a 'stand-off' but is clearly leading and directing the interaction from an expert position, only minimally acknowledging the client's perspective when it arises as resistance to the pre-set agenda.\n\nIn summary, the therapist in this transcript operates primarily from an expert role, directing the conversation and agenda with minimal genuine collaboration or power-sharing, aligning with a Partnership global score of 2."
